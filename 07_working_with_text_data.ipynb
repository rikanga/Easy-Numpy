Only saving grace in the movie were the last thirty minutes, which were seriously funny elsewhere the movie fails miserably. First half was desperately been tried to look funny but wasn't.

Acting is good but thats not enough to keep one interested.<br /><br />For the positives, you can take hot actresses, last 30 minutes, some comic scenes, good acting by the lead cast and the baby.

              "  b'The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a \"Whodunnit?\" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the \"sick sticks\" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.',\n",

The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling. Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved.<br /><br />You can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable. If you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.\",\n",

Importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here, but not flatly on the surface. You could technically call it a \"monster movie\" even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end, and then it\\'s even up to you and your beliefs as to what\\'s happening with the legendary spirit/beast. Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores, though in fact the less you see of the creature, the better.

The thousands of women, up to their ankles in the water, breaking their backs in the burning sun to earn a few bucks, make a truly great setting.<br /><br />'Riso Amaro' has been labeled as 'neo-realism'. Another issue worth mentioning is its female lead Silvana Mangano, ex miss Rome. To the standards of 1949 miss Mangano's performance in this film was shocking. This earned 'Riso Amaro' a lot of publicity, in particular in strongly Roman Catholic Italy.\",\n",
              "  b'Gloomy Sunday - Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod directed by Rolf Sch\\xc3\\xbcbel in 1999 is a romantic, absorbing, beautiful, and heartbreaking movie. It started like Jules and Jim; it ended as one of Agatha Christie\\'s books, and in between it said something about love, friendship, devotion, jealousy, war, Holocaust, dignity, and betrayal, and it did better than The Black Book which is much more popular. It is not perfect, and it made me, a cynic, wonder in the end on the complexity of the relationships and sensational revelations, and who is who to whom but the movie simply overwhelmed me. Perfect or not, it is unforgettable. All four actors as the parts of the tragic not even a triangle but a rectangle were terrific. I do believe that three men could fell deeply for one girl as beautiful and dignified as Ilona in a star-making performance by young Hungarian actress Erica Marozs\\xc3\\xa1n and who would not? The titular song is haunting, sad, and beautiful, and no doubt deserves the movie been made about it and its effect on the countless listeners. I love the movie and I am surprised that it is so little known in this country. It is a gem.<br /><br />The fact that it is based on a story of the song that had played such important role in the lives of all characters made me do some research, and the real story behind the song of Love and Death seems as fascinating as the fictional one. The song was composed in 1930s by Rezs\\xc3\\xb6 Seress and was believed to have caused many suicides in Hungary and all over Europe as the world was moving toward the most devastating War of the last century. Rezs\\xc3\\xb6 Seress, a Jewish-Hungarian pianist and composer, was thrown to the Concentration Camp but survived, unlike his mother. In January, 1968, Seress committed suicide in Budapest by jumping out of a window. According to his obituary in the New York Times, \"Mr. Seres complained that the success of \"Gloomy Sunday\" actually increased his unhappiness, because he knew he would never be able to write a second hit.\" <br /><br />Many singers from all over the world have recorded their versions of the songs in different languages. Over 70 performers have covered the song since 1935, and some famous names include Billie Holiday, Paul Robeson, Pyotr Leschenko (in Russian, under title \"Mratschnoje Woskresenje\"), Bjork, Sarah McLachlan, and many more. The one that really got to me and made me shiver is by Diamanda Gal\\xc3\\xa1s, the Greek born American singer/pianist/performer with the voice of such tragic power that I still can\\'t get over her singing. Gal\\xc3\\xa1s has been described as \"capable of the most unnerving vocal terror\", and in her work she mostly concentrates on the topics of \"suffering, despair, condemnation, injustice and loss of dignity.\" When she sings the Song of Love and Death, her voice that could\\'ve belonged to the most tragic heroines of Ancient Greece leaves no hope and brings the horror and grief of love lost forever to the unbearable and incomparable heights.<br /><br />8.5/10',\n",
              "  b\"This movie was ridiculous. The plot is completely unbelievable. A woman bets her boss that she can 'lose a guy in ten days.' A man bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. What can go wrong? Too much. The movie was not funny. It showed women as catty and men as stupid. There is no reason why he would 'want to keep her' and there is no reason that she 'would fall in love with him.' Granted, they are doing stupid and idiotic things on purpose, but after finding out that they were lying to each other, all is forgiven! And of course the climax is played out in public. Typical Hollywood. In reality, they would be so upset that they lied to each other that they would never see each other again. And any talking would be out of the line of curious ears. But of course, movies are not based on reality.<br /><br />Kate Hudson is very pretty and Matthew McConaughey is quite handsome. The costumes, especially the yellow dress that Hudson wears at the end, are gorgeous. I do think that Hudson as Andie Anderson and McConaughey as Benjamin Barry did well with their talents, but the movie itself stinks. No matter how talented you are, you cannot save a sinking ship.<br /><br />I'm sure several people will like this movie and that is fine, everyone has different tastes. I am a romantic, but I pride myself on being a sensible romantic. Movies of this kind are not romantic to me, just wastes of time. If you want a quality love story, go with something else. If you don't mind killing time and wasting your hard-earned money, then this may be the movie for you.\",\n",
              "  b\"Why was this movie made? No doubt to sucker in the family-rebelling MTV faithful, many of whom do not care about anything other than the exterior of a movie - in Go the story about drugs and sex, and the crude humor. While the plot line of the movie is interesting, the unsympathetic and underdeveloped characters give us nothing to care about.<br /><br />What is most bothersome is that at the end of the movie nobody learns anything. This movie would have been much better if it had a point. It makes brief and ambivalent references to family life, but never really has the guts to develop its critiques.<br /><br />I guess what makes this movie so pathetic is that every character is like all the other characters. What's worse, never in the film, not even at the climax, do any characters distinguish themselves. The four men in Vegas hardly differ at all, and the three convenience store workers are all the same. If you want to waste your 7 bucks on uninspiring and forgettable slop, Go is waiting for you.\",\n",

              "  b\"***WARNING SOME SPOILERS*** The Giant Behemoth was one of the last giant monster-on-the-loose films of the 1950's, a decade that saw all manner of creatures born of the two biggest scientific issues of the decade- space exploration and nuclear weapons. Behemoth fell into the second category, a genre started with the excellent Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, and elaborated upon with Godzilla and Them! However, by the time Behemoth rolled before the cameras, the concept of atomically created monsters had already worn thin. Nevertheless, this is one of the better films of its type; a real gem made on a budget so tiny that it wouldn't even cover the cost of a current feature's end credit listings!<br /><br />Credit for the film's cult reputation must go to the men behind the Behemoth. Although Jack Rabin, Irving Block and Louis DeWitt are first billed in the effects credits, it was King Kong's Willis O'Brien and his assistant Pete Peterson, that brought the Behemoth to life. Their Paleosaurus- though in some ways reminiscent of the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms-is nonetheless a unique creation, with its long neck and legs giving it a stature that makes it tower over most of its surroundings. The skin of the model is finely detailed, with hundreds of minute scales, while the back has a single row of serrated plates, a very realistic model in spite of the movie's low-budget pedigree. The animation, mostly created by Peterson while in a wheelchair due to his advanced multiple sclerosis, is superb; Peterson had learned well from master craftsman O'Brien, and ensured the dinosaur's movements would seem natural, even giving it something of a personality.<br /><br />Despite Peterson and O'Brien's expertise, the film does have some technical flaws (the stiff, live-action prop head that rams the ferryboat is regrettable) but effective stop-motion scenes counterbalance these missteps. In an atmospheric night scene reminiscent of Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, the Behemoth, in silhouette, wanders into some power lines, reacting first with shock, then anger as it attacks the high-tension towers. In the first stop-motion scene of the monster rising from the Thames, the Behemoth strides towards the camera, attacks some dockside cranes, and continues forward, eventually passing over the camera- a trademark of O'Brien's visual style. Sadly, this was also the last film that highlighted his stop-motion work. This makes the movie significant for historians, and a must for buffs.<br /><br />Another aspect of Behemoth that makes it compare favorably to most of its contemporaries at the time was the direction by Eugene Lourie, and the elegant, understated performances. Lourie (who had previously directed Beast From 20,000 Fathoms) attempted to repeat that success with Behemoth, this time not only directing, but screenwriting as well. However, budgetary restrictions forced Lourie to keep the monster off-screen for a longer time. Instead of shots of the monster actually attacking ships and structures (as Ray Harryhausen had done in Beast) Lourie substituted after-the-fact sequences (such as a beached steamship). Not until the creature has actually entered London is the viewer allowed a good look at it. However, it's to Lourie's credit that he eschewed the non-essential romantic subplot typical of most 50's B-movies. As the film was an Anglo-American production, he made the story into an English mystery of sorts, similar to the Dr. Quartermass films. We know from the start that something radioactive is killing fish and men off the coast of England, but it's up to the lead characters to solve the riddle of the source of the radioactivity.<br /><br />In the opening of the film, an American biologist, Steven Karnes (played by Gene Evans) is lecturing a group of scientists about the dangers of not only nuclear weapons testing, but the disposal of radioactive wastes- a warning still timely 45 years later! Evans plays his role straight and understated- he's the hero, yet doesn't let his character exceed what would be expected of a scientist investigating an unusual phenomenon. Likewise, his British counterpart, Prof. Bickford (Andre Morrell) also plays low-key. Evans even allows Karnes to undergo a subtle change in his behavior. In the beginning of the movie, Karnes's blunt, direct (American) attitude puts off the reserved Bickford and other English authorities. Eventually, Karnes begins to adopt a more diplomatic manner, ultimately suggesting rather than demanding that a torpedo be the ideal means of destroying the Behemoth. By treating the film as a detective thriller, Lourie managed to keep it moving, involving the cast in various bits of business that hold the audience even when the animal does not appear. Once the Behemoth surfaces, however, the film exchanges mystery for spectacle, even if on a smaller scale than Beast or Gorgo, Lourie's 3rd (and most spectacular) monster on the loose epic.<br /><br />The only real letdown (other than the prop head) is the demise of the creature. Unlike Beast, with its spectacular finale- as the monster reared up before a burning roller coaster and finally expired- (a nice Harryhausen touch) the Behemoth is simply struck and blown up by the torpedo. Instead of a stop-motion shot of the monster dead or mortally wounded, the unrealistic prop head briefly rises for a final time before plunging into the depths of an obvious studio tank. O'Brien and Peterson probably didn't have time to film the creature's destruction in a more dramatic fashion, although they were certainly capable of wringing pathos out of their creations. The musical score, by Edwin Ashley, while not as bold as David Buttloph's for Beast, still provides both low key tension during non-monster sequences and dramatic enhancement during the monster's rampage. Ashley's work here was likely influenced by passages from Stravinsky's Rite of Spring; it has a primitive, visceral power. Those who like their dinosaur thrills high tech (CGI) may find Behemoth dated, but for those who admire old-fashioned craftsmanship, and for fans of this unique genre, I recommend taking a look at this minor classic.\",\n",

Movies like this don\\'t need spoilers, because YOU already know them.<br /><br />The \"plot\" for this \"film\", is as follows: Nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Secret Government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by Government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the \"film\"; nerd and girl are captured; the Top Secret Government computer gets crazy; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames \"film\"; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. <br /><br />The end.<br /><br />The acting, script, effects, score, and cinematography are what you would expect-- B-grade. Some familiar faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid this one. Granted, the movie won\\'t make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap looking STDVD sequels, then you are right at home.<br /><br />Sadly, Mathew Broderick was too involved with some \"masterpiece\", that he couldn\\'t even do a five second cameo in this one. But can you blame him?',\n",
              "  b'Bizarre Tobe Hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man(Brad Dourif)with the ability to set people on fire. This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50\\'s. They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend, Lisa(Cynthia Bain)gives him to take for rough migraines. In actuality, Lisa was told to manipulate Sam into taking the pills by Lew Orlander(William Prince), pretty much the young man\\'s father who raised him from a child. Lew has benevolent plans..he sees Sam as the first \"Atomic Man\", a pure killing machine in human form. Sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition. As the film goes, Sam\\'s blood is slowly growing toxic, green in color instead of red. It seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when Sam\\'s uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite. Come to find out, Lisa has Sam\\'s condition whose parents also dies from SHC. Dr. Marsh(Jon Cypher), someone who Sam has known for quite some time as his physician, is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies, I\\'m guessing to increase their levels of flame. Nina(Melinda Dillon, sporting an accent that fades in and out)was Sam\\'s parents\\' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50\\'s who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening. And, Rachel(Dey Young)is Sam\\'s ex-wife who may be working against her former husband with Lew and Marsh to harm him and Lisa.<br /><br />Quite a strange little horror flick, filled with some pretty awful flame-effects. Dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices. There\\'s this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time. Best scene is probably when director John Landis, who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform Sam to hang up because the radio program he\\'s calling has sounded off for the night, becomes a victim of SHC. The flick never quite works because it\\'s so wildly uneven with an abrupt, ridiculous finale where Sam offers to free Lisa of her fire by taking it from her.',\n",
              "  b'Well, maybe the PC version of this game was impressive. Maybe. I just finished playing the PS2 version and it\\'s pretty much a complete mess.<br /><br />There are a couple elements that are okay or promising. I\\'ll mention those first because it will be over quickly. First, the idea of a historical GTA-like game is a great one. The game Gun was a historical GTA-like game and unlike Mafia, Gun was excellent. I\\'d love to see a game set during Mafia\\'s era done right. Next, the storyline is well written. The story makes sense, it has dramatic arcs, it uses an unusual device (with much of the game being a backstory) and it\\'s interesting. Finally, some of the graphics--especially those used during cutscenes--are impressive. Mafia\\'s designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where GTA skimped on that effort, especially the characters. Unfortunately in many other areas, the graphics kinda stink, and I\\'d much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive-looking characters.<br /><br />The gameplay is what sinks this title so low. First off, the controls and camera absolutely suck. That has to be the first focus of any game developers. You can\\'t release a game where the controls and/or camera suck. Number one, there\\'s no reason that the player\\'s character, Tom, can\\'t have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick. Unless it\\'s absolutely necessary, and it hardly ever is, I hate the set-up where the left stick moves the character in a \"strafing\" way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick. Here, it\\'s not only unnecessary, it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge. For example, Tom has to climb on a couple missions. But the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera, and then press L1 every time you need to climb, or Tom will descend instead.<br /><br />Next, I\\'ve never seen a worse fighting system. The first problem is that you can\\'t auto-aim or lock on to any targets. At one early point, the game seems to tell you that you can use L2 or R2 to lock on to targets, but that never worked. So to focus on any enemy, you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character\\'s orientation and the camera, which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make Tom disappear all the time. By that time, you\\'re probably getting pummeled or shot to death.<br /><br />Next, if you\\'re touching or almost touching an enemy--and that\\'s certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons, the fighting system--which primarily consists of tapping or holding R1, is completely useless. Enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug, but you just can\\'t move unless you back off. So close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick, yelling at the character to move away, which it won\\'t do 50% of the time, then tapping R1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes R1 useless. And if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime, you\\'re also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything. By that time, you\\'re probably getting pummeled or shot again, and your only option will be to try to move the character away again. My fights often consisted of making Tom run circles around an area like a comedy film, hoping that I could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the AI\\'s mercy again. So much for realistic fighting.<br /><br />And the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns. If you\\'re touching someone, half the time the controller just won\\'t allow you to fire off a shot, yet they can still riddle you full of holes. Additionally, there\\'s no auto-aim, and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive, even with the sensitivity set to zero under Options. Gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you. Luckily or not, damage seems to be recorded almost randomly. It can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character, and there\\'s no rhyme or reason to it. You can put five shots into an enemy\\'s head and near point blank range and they\\'ll still return fire and hurt you. Yet, the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system, so after shots with powerful enough guns, your aim will float off target, and you\\'ll have to fight with it again.<br /><br />As for the celebrated graphics, except for the characters and textures that you\\'re close to, they\\'re actually pretty disappointing. The distance always seems mostly empty, and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you\\'re driving. The city wasn\\'t very well designed. It\\'s not varied enough, and there aren\\'t many interesting things to see or do. The cars seem slow and they\\'re difficult to control. They also all drive about the same. Some have mentioned the music, but that was also pretty nondescript. A much better job could have been done on that end. Also, as many others have mentioned, the load times are ridiculous and constant. They tend to be over a minute long, and they occur between and in the middle of everything--even races.<br /><br />Overall, the Mafia port to PS2, at least, seems to have been very rushed. The game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job.',\n",
              "  b'Jeff Speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like \"The Expert\", you can see why. There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - are all over the place, there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose, 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total, some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark, 3) The music score is overzealous and overbearing. Strange as it may seem, this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that you\\'re watching some sort of grand epic, instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching. With all that said, at least there\\'s James Brolin around to lend a touch of credibility. *1/2 out of 4.',\n",
              "  b\"yes i really said that, i ain't into all that cgi superhero bull, i like all out action flicks like the mechanik, a brutal revenge movie with some of the best action iv'e seen for years. Dolph lundgren is a badaass in this and made me remember how much i love him sure he was never as big a star as most of the action hero's of the 80's but as he proves here, he's the one who's ruling the genre now cus he plays one mean mofo here, the story has Dolph's wife and kid murdered by the Russian mafia, he moves to los angelos and seven years later he is asked to go back to Russia to bring back somebody's daughter back, he refuses to do it at first until he realises it is the same gangster that killed his family seven years ago, so he goes to get his bloody revenge, the mechanik is violent and dark but its great entertainment and delivers the goods, sure the story has been done many times before but the way it is made and its style just make the mechanik an action classic, Dolph lundgren also directed it and does a brilliant job crafting one of the best action/thriller's for the past ten years.

              "  b'Watching \"Kroko\" I would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life. I would not recommend to watch this movie: flat main characters - absolutely no development e.g. Kroko the metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot-wise chances to do so. Uninspired actors, non-evolving plot. I guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed: camera appeared shaky rather than motivated. Pictures were low - contrast, gray and dark - i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu. The story had certain potential though, it could have made a good short story.',\n",
              "  b\"First of all, I have to start this comment by saying I'm a huge Nightmare on Elm Street fan. I think it's the greatest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, which tried to be the last chapter back then, is a weird movie. It doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some think it makes him less scary, which I do agree. And that's, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so we can know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he were, how he became the man haunting our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil. Obviously those people won't like Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. To truly enjoy this one, you have to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you. This was the first one, and it was awesome. As the years passed by, Freddy killed more and more people, and nobody could ever get rid of him for good. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's realm of terror. Beside the story of Freddy's past, I also really liked the atmosphere of the movie. No more kids in Springwood, only crazy grown-ups. The nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the opening song called ''I'm Awake Now'' performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can't believe it's so underrated. Maybe it is misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too, and a lot of cameos! Get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed.\",\n",
              "  b\"Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue, bad flashbacks, and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men.<br /><br />O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he, too, is terribly underused.<br /><br />The film has one additional positive aspect, in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many of today's films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil, when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!<br /><br />This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is the movie for you.\",\n",
              "  b\"Man... I thought I'd seen some bad movies before, but this is seriously the worst ever. Its so bad, that if you are even the least bit drunk or high you'll find this movie hilarious. There are 6-8 totally ugly chicks who all just keep getting naked. The production value is zero, think high school project done in a weekend. It was obviously filmed in a park, and nothing, no amount of seeing the people in the movie naked could ever make up for how terrible this movie is. Yea I laughed my ass off, but if you have to spend even one dollar on it, its overpriced. I caught it on latenight television, and I felt bad, really bad, for everyone involved in the movie. You can't plan on making something this bad, it has to just happen. A quick spoiler: the hobbits, or whatever they're called in this movie, enter a tavern which is supposed to be in the forrest in medieval time and make out on the tavern pool table, which looks brand new. Man... SO bad.\",\n",
              "  b\"SPOILERS<br /><br />Yes, yes, I know this is not a Holiday show, let alone movie, but I really wanted to comment on it. This show is created by who else than Matt Groening, who obviously created the Simpsons. Although it may not be as good as the Simpsons it is still a fantastic comedic cartoon. The characters in Futurama also have overbites like the characters in the Simpsons. The characters are not yellow, though. As you know by now, Futurama takes place in the future, so there are robots, aliens, one-eyed aliens that look like regular humans, people from Mars that look like regular people, one hundred sixty year old men, and much, much more. The future contains tubes that suck people to places, booths that can kill you, and hover cars. <br /><br />A pizza delivery boy named Fry who goes out to deliver pizza. It is almost the year 2000. At the place where he is supposed to deliver the pizza he falls into a freezer. He is frozen. One thousand years go by. It is the year 3000. When he thaws out he is flabbergasted at what he sees. He learns that his nephew Professor Farnsworth lives close by. He meets a robot named Bender. All he does is drink and smoke cigars. He meets Leela, a one-eyed alien that looks like a regular human. She chases him to make him get his delivery job. He finds Farnsworth. Bender, Leela, and Fry become delivery people, alien, and robot. Fry also meets Amy, Hermes, and Dr. Zoidberg. All of them go on zany adventures.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic cartoon. Although it may not be as good, it's still great. I never found this show to be as funny as the Simpsons, though. I mean, there's laugh-out-loud moments, but just no as much as the Simpsons had. I also found some endings to Futurama are incredibly sad and depressing. Some of the endings include the ending to Jurassic Bark, when a flashback shows that Fry's dog in the past had waited next to the pizza parlour for Fry to return for the rest of his life. I mean, it's so sad, the dog had waited for him. The dog's eyes were so sad and hopeful. Also the end in Time Keeps on Slipping was really depressing. Anyway, this is a great show.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Recommended Titles: The Simpsons.\",\n",
              "  b'\"Die Hard\" is the prototype type for the modern action film. Since it\\'s also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing. \"Die Hard\" is lean, mean, and doesn\\'t contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since \"Die Hard\" was first released in 1988, it\\'s difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn\\'t follow the basic structure and format of \"Die Hard\" . . . or, for that matter, is better than \"Die Hard\".<br /><br />\"Die Hard\" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures. Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it\\'s up to John McClane to save the day . . . .<br /><br />Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim. The story isn\\'t completely believable, but it\\'s believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over. There\\'s also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what\\'s going to happen next . . . and the surprises don\\'t come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out. (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, \"Die Hard\" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written. McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action. A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, \"Die Hard\" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that\\'s why it stands out so clearly from them all. With \"Die Hard\", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.<br /><br />As for the acting, it\\'s darn near close to perfect. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. As played by Willis, McClane\\'s a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane\\'s also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. There\\'s more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism. The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it\\'s darn brilliant. (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.) There\\'s only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman\\'s performance as the villain Hans Gruber. The Machiavellian Gruber would\\'ve been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn\\'t travel the easy route. Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero. He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it\\'s hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand. Other actors probably could\\'ve played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains. As for the rest of the cast, they\\'re all pretty good. Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John\\'s soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual \"damsel in distress\" mold. It\\'s also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero. The character is stupid to a fault, and he\\'s wonderful because of it.<br /><br />\"Die Hard\" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly. There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is \"Die Hard\" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it\\'s undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film. Grade: A',\n",

              "  b\"This movie has no redeeming qualities (okay a couple of inventive deaths but you'll be bored getting to them). Writing a review of it seems to be a waste of time but I've already wasted 90 minutes of my life watching it so if I can stop other people from doing the same then it was worth it. Think for a minute what makes bad horror movies so bad and you have Night of the Scarecrow. The director needs to go back to film school and study suspense again because this movie doesn't have any. Let me say this one last time: gore does not equal horror!!! The gore in the movie is even quite lame. I find Scarecrows scary so I had high hopes for this film but it's just another example of why horror movies get such a bad rap. The acting is mediocre as are the few shocks that the film has.

The movie made wandered away from the book so much, it was almost painful to see it. <br /><br />First of all Dr. Mortimer was a young man and his age was the key in the opening sequence of the novel. By making him an old large man destroyed the very beginning of the story. <br /><br />Then, the main characters - In one scene Holmes is using violence to get his way, which he NEVER did unless the situation was life-threatening. If we was beating people up to get answers then he would be a pretty dumb detective. Besides that, this Holmes is arrogant and a big snob. I am not so fond of the original character, but he was better than this. And Watson is so undeveloped. He is like a enclosure to Holmes, just sitting there and doing nothing, while Holmes is babbling on and on (he never babbled, he was a man of silent action). <br /><br />And the plot was changes so much, I don't know where to start pointing out the wrongs. I will only say, that Barrymore was flashing the lights for the runaway murderer who just happened to be his wife's brother. Why did he do it - the spouses were feeding him, while his was hiding before moving to South America (he never had the chance).\",\n",

              "  b\"NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA has almost everything to be a successful epic: distinguished cast, impressive sets, good production values; the only thing missing is a real epic feeling. In emphasizing the personal story of the imperial couple, the director neglected the epic grandeur of the tale and period to the point that the result resembles a claustrophobic stage play full of talking heads rather than a real movie that shows EVERYTHING that happens in the story=thousands of soldiers, thousands of civilians, the endless landscapes of Russia, etc. This is a Shakespearean tragedy that demands GRANDEUR, but is instead filmed as if it were one of those bourgeois plays by Chekhov about silly provincial families wasting their time and lives in silly provincial towns. There are so many opportunities for GRANDEUR: the astounding Battle of Tsu Shima--one of the grandest battles in naval history--which ended the Russo-Japanese War; the huge battles of the Great War--Tannenberg, the Brusilov Offensive--; the civil war between the Reds and the Whites=all these would have made dynamic and exciting cinema! Apparently the budget for the movie was exhausted in hiring the all-star supporting cast, for the epic events of Nicholas' reign are merely suggested by symbolic gestures: a few soldiers marching here, a few civilians demonstrating there, photographs of Wilhelm II and Franz Joseph I to represent the enemy at World War I, etc. Franklin Schaffner evidently thought that he was directing a stage production, where representing mighty battles and broad vistas was impossible. How could that happen?! The director of such perfectly exciting movies as THE WAR LORD, PLANET OF THE APES (1968) and PATTON should have known better! All in all, a sadly wasted opportunity; what could have been a brilliant epic worthy of David Lean turned instead into a solid but stolid plod.\",\n",

Even Lena Fisher's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach who is aware of and opposed to the Holocost cautions Lena against it. but Lena chooses to embrace the idea with an American rebelliousness even renaming Ruth, the more aryan sounding name Helga Lehmann.<br /><br />The siege ends favourably on Rosenstrasse but Lena mourns: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later Ruth's daughter Hannah sets out in search of her mother's past and meets 90 year old Lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war.<br /><br />I did deem it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the Ostfront.\",\n",
              "  b'Nell Shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the Maxwell automobile\\'s off-road capabilities. The plot of the movie is pretty simple, Nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writer\\'s block, and needs inspiration, so she goes to visit Mexico to absorb the atmosphere. There she meets the hero (Bert Van Tuyle), a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse. While Nell is visiting with her father\\'s partner at his mining camp, a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness. The hero needs to get to her quickly, so he decides to drive there in his car. This is where the film takes a weird twist. Bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable, huge rocks, small streams, heavy brush, scraggly tree stumps, steep inclines, etc etc, for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles. Now mind you, this isn\\'t a modern-day ATV, it\\'s a 1920 Maxwell automobile, so it looks very out-of-place as an off-road vehicle. And it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters, we get to see it stuck more than once in this film. But the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles. Once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl, he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit (on horseback), and at this point it became hysterically funny to me. Watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks, getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush, going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs, the bandits should have had ample time to catch up. But they never do, even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night. And in a silly climax, the car climbs a mountainside, and helps Nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits.<br /><br />After seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 Maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off-road capabilities than Hummers and Bradley tanks combined. Watch this film just for laughs, it\\'s worth it just to see Nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying \"You did your best, brave little car\"',\n",
              "  b'One of the best parts of Sundance is seeing movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss. Unless you\\'re a real art-house devotee, you probably don\\'t catch many documentaries. Only a handful get any recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years.<br /><br />Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year a group of inmates present a Shakespearean play. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the troupe as roles are self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed and ultimately performed.<br /><br />The movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us that have not been exposed to prison environments. Despite the labels we know them by (convict, felon, murderer, etc.) we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking feeling human beings. Serendipitously, the play chosen for the year of filming was The Tempest, with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption. The actors all grapple with the relevance of the play to their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama.<br /><br />For a documentary film, like a book, the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation for me. \"O brave new world, that has such creatures in it.\"',\n",
              "  b'It\\'s very easy to criticise a film like \"for the boys\", after all it is sentimental and there is singing, a sure fire vote killer. Despite this I liked it, in fact I more than liked it. Why because it has a heart it may be sentimental sometimes but it works, the singing works, and there isn\\'t that much of it.<br /><br />The reason this film really works is Bette Midler that age old phrase a tour de force is the only thing that you can say, the woman is fantastic. Sassy, vulnerable, moving. She brings to the part a great depth and an impressive range of emotions, most of which are underplayed, making them all the more powerful for it. Well deserving of her Oscar nomination and a little robbed not being chosen as the winner. James Cann is also very good and the production values are high well written and all in all much better than you might think.<br /><br />Yes there are some dodgy bits like the old age make up, though the makeup in the sixties was better, the ending is weak and it was a pity to go out with a whimper considering the rest of the film had such balls. These though are not enough to spoil the film.',\n",

              "  b'The first thing I always tell myself before I watch a low-budget Sci-Fi film is: \"be prepared: it\\'s bound to be bad to at least some noticeable degree.\" Occasionally, there\\'s a film that passes by that is decent enough to be watchable and those films get my praise for their results on such a low budget. However, very few of them get to that level. Most of them are what they are: bad films. And \"King of the Lost World\" is about as bad as they get.<br /><br />The film is said to be based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s novel \"The Lost World\". I personally have never read it, but based on the previous film adaptations of the story, I can assume that it is nothing like the novel. Pretty much there are only two possible similarities that I see from them. One: a lost world with monsters. Two: the names of some of the characters. Speaking of the characters, they are about as bland and irritating as ever. They are just what I expected, or worse. There\\'s the tough guy wanting to be a leader, his assistant who will take over some point during the film, girls who are just there to scream and be love interests for our leading characters, and characters that are just simply annoying to the other characters and even more so annoying to the audience. The new plot is very dull and it just takes odd twists and turns and adds unnecessary and extremely underdeveloped subplots that lead up to keys in the climax. A climax which we don\\'t really care about.<br /><br />Special effects on the film are even worse that I expected. The CGI graphics used in \"King of the Lost World\" are absolutely horrendous. We see giant insects and other creatures that look so incredibly cheap, they aren\\'t even laughable. And the way they are incorporated in with the sound effects and the action is inexcusable. I remember this one sequence where Bruce Boxleitner\\'s character shoots his gun at a giant scorpion or something like that. We hear a gunshot that is so quiet it\\'s like a dull thump, and then the scorpion just simply whips away from sight, so quickly it almost just disappears. Other graphics are so horrible they seem to be blurry. That mostly revolves around the so-called \"King\" of this Lost World, who I assume is the giant gorilla whom we see next to nothing of for a long time. Good thing, too. Because the graphics used on the giant ape made it almost difficult to see what it was. And that\\'s not all that was blurry. Scenes of our bland human characters and oftentimes in scenes so dark that the camera doesn\\'t even focus very well. It\\'s almost as if somebody filmed it in their back yard using a cheap camcorder.<br /><br />Is there anything positive about \"King of the Lost World\"? Yes. A few things. It had good set designs and a fairly good music score. But that\\'s just about it. Overall, it was just a very bland and mind-numbingly boring excuse for an adventure story. And it\\'s not a patch on the original 1925 version of \"The Lost World\" or the so-so 1960 version.<br /><br />Bottom line: don\\'t bother with it. You can find better even on a long, dark rainy day.',\n",
              "  b\"Predator is the classic action film. What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved. The genius of that! The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end. He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see. Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy. The whole cast worked very well together. <br /><br />The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator. The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius. I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame. I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit. I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) <br /><br />Predator is evidence of how action films should be done. A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along. A timeless classic, one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />**** out of **** stars<br /><br />P.S. The 'forest massacre' scene is one of the funniest scenes in movie history!!\",\n",
              "  b\"I am not a parent, neither am I a male. But I was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains.<br /><br />This is a movie teenagers should watch. Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again. I'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love, family and friendship.<br /><br />It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing. And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006.<br /><br />This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the entire family.<br /><br />I bought this movie on DVD and have watched it with friends many times. Because it portrays the values that are important in life.\",\n",
              "  b\"Very entertaining and affecting story of women's struggle for the vote. Rather than the period-piece drama one would get on a BBC show about the movement, this portrays very modern, very impassioned women. The director is determined to avoid any hint of stuffiness, and at times the gimmicky camera work seems there not to further the story but just to make sure this works for the MTV generation, but the result is a dynamic and entertaining movie. I've never heard much of anything about the women's suffrage movement and it is interesting to see how it played out and to learn a little about the movie's impassioned heroine Alice Paul and her struggle both with the patriarchy and with the more cautious suffragettes. She seems to have been a fascinating woman, and judging from her photographs, almost as cute as Hillary Swank.\",\n",
              "  b'This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between Jeff Webster(Jimmy Stewart) and Ronda Castle(Ruth Roman). She takes an instant liking to Jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder. They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them. Gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from Skagway to Dawson. But Ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff Gannon and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in Skagway. She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff. Meanwhile, Rene, a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return. Yet, she sticks with him in his travels from Skagway to Dawson and his activities around Dawson. Along with Ronda, she nurses him back to health after Jeff is left for dead by Gannon\\'s gunslingers at his gold claim. Walter Brennan, as Ben, serves as Jeff\\'s long time sidekick. He doesn\\'t have a meaty role, but serves to soften Jeff\\'s hard edges. His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for Jeff.<br /><br />John McIntire(as Sheriff Gannon) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. Evidently, he sees something of himself in Jeff, repeatedly declaring that he\\'s going to like him. He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous Soapy Smith, who spent his last years in Skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times.<br /><br />Jeff is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion Ben), who doesn\\'t want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. In this respect, he closely resemble\\'s Burt Lancaster\\'s character in \"Vera Cruz\", for example. Thus, Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson, he is convinced to leave Dawson after Gannon\\'s gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone\\'s insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from Dawson. Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff make a hurried exit from Dawson while they are still alive. Then, Jeff has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of Ben and himself. He changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of Gannon\\'s gang from Dawson. In this respect, he differs from Lancaster\\'s character, who never reforms(But is Jeff truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)<br /><br />The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women. Clearly, Ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame Jeff. Although she is clearly characterized as a \"bad\" girl, Jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon. Ironically, soon after Jeff changes from anti-hero to hero, Rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn Jeff of Gannon\\'s impending ambush. She dies as a result and Jeff asks her why she didn\\'t just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).<br /><br />It\\'s clear that Corine Calvert, as Renee, just doesn\\'t make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda, in Jeff\\'s mind. Yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though Jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug. Her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in Rhonda\\'s saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later. I\\'m also very unclear about her relationship with Rube Morris, a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.(He\\'s not her father).<br /><br />Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between Jeff and Gannon\\'s gang. If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk, before Jeff did the same to him. And how did Jeff\\'s badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims. They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow. And why weren\\'t most of Ronda\\'s pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?<br /><br />You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and Gannon\\'s gang. The sequences shot in the Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. All-in-all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end. No doubt, this film takes some great liberties with history and geography, especially, the part taking place in the Canadian Yukon, which was in fact much tamer than the US Skagway.',\n",
              "  b\"I honestly wasn't expecting Bambi 2 to be as good as it was. I found it it sweet, funny and adorable. The original Bambi is not only one of my favourite Disney movies, but one of my favourite movies ever. I thought this a very worthy sequel, well it was more of a midquel really, if a tad rushed in places. I liked the fact that they focused on Bambi and his father, after his mother dies, and the story itself was very sweet and well crafted. The animation was beautiful here, not quite as splendid as its predecessor. I have seen sequels like FernGully 2 and Secret of NIMH 2 where the animation is dull, tacky and choppy. Here it was colourful, vibrant and fluid, just look at the wondrous backgrounds. And I absolutely loved the soundtrack, that alone contributed to the film's charm. Of course I do slightly prefer the original's music, but the soundtrack here was so pleasant to the ears. The characters were every bit as likable as they were in the first- Bambi if you forgive the fact his facial expressions were overdone at times, was still adorable and appealing, and Thumper is hilarious. If there is one thing I prefer over the original, it is that the sequel is funnier than the original. The original, while having some very funny moments was more of a tearjerker and a genuine one it was too. In the sequel, there are five or six funny bits in the first fifteen minutes alone. The voice acting was most impressive, special mention must go to Patrick Stewart, who was perfect as the Great Prince. My final verdict is that it isn't quite as good as the stunning original, but along with King Of Thieves and Enchanted Christmas, this is in the top 5 of my favourite sequels. A solid 8/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",

Just imagine \"Kill Bill\" cut to 2 hours, without all the dull stuff but with all the goods delivered straight to the point. Everything funny, hysterical, strange and enchanting you can squeeze out of old good Westerns plus amazing Japanese aesthetics (watch the leader of Whites.

The effects are top notch, solid directing, a really imaginative and eerie production design and great acting.<br /><br />Yes, i may be a little biased but i really like Milla Jovovich. I think this is the kind of role that fits her best, strong kick ass attitude with an odd personality wrapped in a seemingly fragile shell. Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in \"The fifth element\" and also the character in the later \"Ultraviolet\" The other actors did a good job as well so she\\'s not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character. The child AI is a very nice and creepy addition to the atmosphere.<br /><br />The RE theme could have ended up as a nice trilogy but the sequel unfortunately lacks nearly everything(except Milla) that this film delivers.

The Gregory Peck character lost his bride during the German bombing of London, needs to find a purpose for living. He'll soon find it, as there's much need for able men not only in the hero department but also pretty girls need attention -- even in the Burma jungle.<br /><br />The themes of duty, courage, purpose, tenacity and redemption ride deep, and there's enough patriotism and faith to make any godless liberals in the audience cringe like Dracula facing a Crucifix. The Burma locations add a lot, as do the high production standards. They knew how to make good movies 50 years ago -- unlike today.<br /><br />This film has real heroes. Today's cocaine-soaked film industry only knows about comic book-style Super Heroes, who fight make-believe enemies using only the weapon of computer animation. They offer nothing to the younger generation save for inspiration fire up the PlayStation. Moral bankruptcy for the Bevis and Butthead audience; grown-ups (12 and older) are the forgotten audience.<br /><br />Gregory Peck made lots of excellent films prior to his dreadful (but Oscar winning) role of Aticus Finch. The Purple Plain is a fine example of his acting and star quality. Sadly, Peck just went to the dogs the last years of his career.<br /><br />Not only were movies better in 1954, but watching them was better. I saw The Purple Plain at Loew's Capitol Theatre -- the most deluxe theater that ever existed in Washington, DC.

              "  b\"The Purple Plain is a winner, a handsomely mounted WW2 drama set in Burma where the Japanese are never seen: the enemy is the hostile landscape and the memories that cripple its hero. Gregory Peck's damaged pilot is still suffering from a bad case of 12 O'Clock High after the death of his wife in an air raid on their wedding night until he falls for Burmese girl Win Min Tan. (This being 1954, they may share an inter-racial romance, but they never actually kiss.) Naturally, as soon as he rediscovers a reason for living he's shot down behind enemy lines and has to make it back with not one but two crippled comrades. It's not much of a plot, true, but it's handled extremely well thanks to Robert Parrish's direction, which is surprisingly strong, direct and imaginative when called for, but still knows when to be unobtrusive as well. Great last shot too.\",\n",

              "  b'While the gameplay of Jedi Knight II is far superior to Jedi Knight, I think the game is a bit of a dissapointment in other areas. For one thing, I much prefer the live action cutscenes in JK1 to the ones rendered with the game engine in JK2. The live action cutscenes really brought the story to life in JK1. Since the acting in JK2 is done by Quake 3 models, the cutscenes lack any sign of life. They look especially lifeless and flat where there are supposed to be emotional scenes, such as Jan and Kyle kissing.<br /><br />I have played JK1 many times and I always watch the cutscenes fully. I even go back sometimes just to watch the cutscenes because they are done so well. When I play JK2 again, I\\'ll probably just skip the cutscenes because I think they look very amateurish. It\\'s almost as if the cutscenes are an afterthought to join the levels together, not as a part of the overall story as in Jedi Knight.<br /><br />*Spoilers below*<br /><br />Now we come to the story. While JK2\\'s story is ok, it is no where near as good as JK1. In the beginning of the game we find out that Kyle has given up his force abilities. He and Jan now operate as mercenaries for the New Republic. After several levels fighting imperials, it appears as if Jan is killed by a Dark Jedi called Desann. Kyle then goes to Luke Skywalker to get his lightsaber and force abilities back so he can avenge Jan\\'s death.<br /><br />Now here is the really odd part about this story. It doesn\\'t seem to bother Luke that Kyle wants to regain his force powers so he can get revenge. If I understand Star Wars correctly, revenge along with fear, hate, agression, etc... will lead to the Dark side! Don\\'t you think Luke would try to object to this a bit more? The rest of it is pretty average \"kill the bad guy and get the girl\" type stuff.<br /><br />*Spoilers end*<br /><br />Overall, Raven have done an excellent job with the gameplay and level design, but the story is pretty average and I REALLY WANT PROPER CUTSCENES!!!<br /><br />I gave it 8/10 though because the game is a lot of fun to play and the multiplayer is excellent. If it wasn\\'t for the excellent gameplay, I would have only given it 5/10.',\n",
              "  b'The main reason for writing this review is I found this \"revisioning\" of a great play and worthy 1972 film, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone from watching it, I will have done a good thing.<br /><br />This \"new\" version is loaded with talent, and it all goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OKs an ugly, sterile, one note set. He proceeds to film the movie from every arty, distracting, self-centered angle possible. We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close ups of eyes, chins, and on and on. The screenplay, by a Nobel Laureate, introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter, that is being faked by both parties,.... I think?? Given the character \"twists\" how would I know? The characters themselves,so richly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. The running time has been cut by an hour, which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the Director did for us. The actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. Jude Law is over the top more than Caine, but as the credited Producer, must have had Branagh\\'s blessing.<br /><br />All in all I found this to be an ugly to look at, unconvincing shell of a former classic. Why was it even made??? The paying public spent less that $4M worldwide to see it! A vanity piece of work that fails at every turn.',\n",
              "  b'Perhaps the problem with this movie is the fact that the director is a Serbian filmmaker. Or that the co-writer is his wife. It could be that his Balkan background was ill equipped to adapt a Chinese story to a 1920\\'s Irish village. (Maybe the multi-national money people behind this project insisted on using Ireland.) Whatever the reason, when you name your leading character \"Meaney\", portray virtually all the characters in a realistic style and then have the main character turn into a tree, then you\\'ve got a melange that sinks under the woven strands of too many stylistic ideas. <br /><br />I would also like to comment on the cinematographer\\'s lighting (though ultimately the director has to o.k. the look when he sees the dailies.) Disclaimer: I worked as a lighting technician in the mainstream U.S. film industry for 25 years. Most of the time when movies are transferred from film/digital to DVD, the bottom line is to do it as cheaply as one can. One really can\\'t fairly comment on good lighting or bad lighting because of this (this cheap approach also heavily impacts sound transfer). But in this film the aesthetic behind many of the interior scenes was that of a hack; let\\'s bash the light in and shoot it. There\\'s way too much \"flat\" lighting. That is, no contrast in the light on faces or objects EVEN THOUGH THE LIGHT SOURCES LEND THEMSELVES TO GREAT POTENTIAL LIGHTING; lighting that could help further the story.<br /><br />Good performances don\\'t make it when they are serving a poor story in a technically flawed movie.',\n",
              "  b\"This film reminded me of going to the zoo. Here you have a community of individuals that are captured by the thought of a longer life, freedom, and food, only when they arrive (like animals in zoo); they are shocked by the realism that it is not a vacation. Food will be served at your captor's convenience, your captors determine the chain of command as well, and finally, nobody can leave once they arrive. After WWII, under Stalin's regime, Russia invites all defectors back to their homeland, but it is a trick. Est-Ouest tells the story of one family's plight to escape a country that has transformed into a wall-less prison. With the KGB watching their every move, our heroes must risk everything to see the light of freedom once more. Living in a post 9/11 world, one cannot help but begin to see the similarities between what Alexei and Marie and the Arab world in America. While not quite as harsh, we constantly are reminded about the vengeful eye of our government and the illustrious Patriot Act.<br /><br />Est-Ouest is one of those films where you could either be excited and happy by the results or be bursting into an emotional sea of tears. From the opening credit sequence until the darkened words crept back on the screen, this film captivated me. With the powerful acting, the intense story, and the brilliant work behind the camera, Est-Ouest will pull hard on your emotions and not release you until the very end. Director R\\xc3\\xa9gis Wargnier has done a superb job of bringing the history of the characters, as well as the land, straight into your hearts. He does this with some of the most common techniques and a very simple story. This is a story about love and freedom. He uses these simplistic structures to keep us focused on the overall depth and tone of the film. There is this feeling of being in a non-barred cage, unable to escape, unable to be free due to the vengeful eye of your comrades. Wargnier forces you to feel for these characters, from the beginning until the end, because they are no different than you are I. They are placed in a situation like no other, yet somehow so real that we could witness it happen even today.<br /><br />From our initial meeting with Alexei and Marie on the boat heading to Russia, we are bombarded with a sense of pride, love, and fear all at once. We are unfamiliar with the relationship between Alexei and Marie, but immediately take it as a loving one. Perhaps we are too haste with that decision, because as our story unfolds, as does the bond that connects these two individuals \\xc2\\x85 or at least that is what Wargnier would like us to think. Est-Ouest is more than just a story about escaping to freedom, it is a contrast between patience and immediate self-sacrifice. Marie wants to escape the cold world they inhabit immediately, she wants to see Paris again and taste its freedom, while Alexei does as well, just not quite as quickly. He understands the rules of the nation, and slowly sets in motion a plan that will give his wife all that he has promised. It took me until the end of the film to see this contrast between immediate escape and patience. While I thought that it was a great message to show, I felt as if the timing was a bit off throughout the film. I had trouble following the timeline, while I did realize that several years had passed between these horrific events, the only person that seemed to age was Alexei's son. I needed a stronger connection between these riveting scenes so that I could keep track in my mind the time that had passed.<br /><br />The acting was gorgeous. Oleg Menshikov and Sandrine Bonnaire had such a powerful connection on screen that I could not keep my eyes off them. When they were together you wanted them to be, and when they were apart, you dreamt of them being back together. You cannot say that of many film characters. The late Sergei Bodrov Jr. reminded me of a Russian Brad Pitt. The way he carried himself and acted in this film was similar to that of Mr. Pitt. Together these three key players brought this film to life. While somehow Catherine Deneuve received top billing as well, she didn't seem to carry as much of the weight that I had hoped that she would. While she was vital to the story, I felt she could have brought more to her character. The depth behind her words just wasn't there or just didn't seem to match the emotion of everyone else.<br /><br />The only other negative aspect that I have with this film was that I felt the story seemed incomplete. There were moments where we were given a nibble to enjoy, but never fully developed those nibbles into bites. There were elements of the story that needed to be developed further, such as the relationship between Sasha and Marie. While I did see some evolution when they were in Russia, it was later that I needed the follow-up. It just felt as if some strings were not tied at the end, but instead left frayed with questions looming in the air.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a very tight drama. There were some flaws with may have caused it to loose its Oscar win in 1999, but nonetheless, the good did outweigh the bad. The characters were intense, the story (outside of the loose ends) was captivating, and being able to see a darker side of the world was thrilling. Simply put, this was a story about freedom and love, and those are themes that transcend throughout history. Est-Ouest is a story for seeing the destructive nature of Stalinism and its impact on humanity.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****\",\n",

This is not the way Godzilla was meant to be.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is dire. Matthew Broderick as the man character Nick Stutapolis or what ever the heck his name is, is perhaps the worst acting I have ever seen on film. Nothing in the movie is familiar with the Godzilla we all know and love from Japan. Godzilla is portrayed in this film as just another one of them Jurassic Park dinosaurs instead of a kick ass dinosaur that shoots atomic breath.<br /><br />I hate this movie.

It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect were horrible, I hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?<br /><br />Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me, it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder. There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least.<br /><br />What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are awful. The chief of army staff looks unconvincing. To make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours.\",\n",

In their pursuit of this innocent woman, they wine and dine her, and ultimately humiliate her in such a way that can only be describes as inhuman.

Once in the lake, one by one is killed by a murderer, and the survivors guess who might be the criminal.<br /><br />\"Adam & Evil\" is the perfect cheesy movie: the silly and flawed screenplay seems to be written by a moron, so stupid it is with laughable dialogs and situations; the shameful direction is inexistent; the unknown ham actors and actresses show a total lack of talent at least in this movie. The story has lots of holes and clich\\xc3\\xa9s, and it is funny to see, for example, the car fully loaded with eight persons, and I guess where all of the camping stuff was transported. When the group finds that there are three dead friends, they split to facilitate the work of the killer.

              "  b'It is true that Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy were far more effective in their national audience on radio than in the movies. This was due to the close-up affect of cinematography on Bergen\\'s face - he could not hide the fact that his lips moved a little. When on a stage in a nightclub or in vaudeville he\\'d be too far away to be seen moving his lips. Not so on film. <br /><br />But Bergan and McCarthy put ventriloquism on the map. Their act and radio show took the art of throwing one\\'s voice and brought a biting humor to it, giving the dummy a real personality: a wise guy little man, with an eye for the ladies and an eye for making trouble for people he did not like (among whom was Fields). The feud of McCarthy and Fields mirrored the contemporary feud of Fred Allan and Jack Benny, except that Allan and Benny were both real. But on radio Charlie was as real as \"Uncle Claude\" was, so the fact that it was a block of wood that was manipulated fighting a real life man did not matter. The public just loved Charlie reminding Fields of his alcoholism, in particular his large red nose. And the public loved the threats of Fields to give Charlie a ride on a buzz saw.<br /><br />Because of the strong personality of McCarthy, a movie audience even today looks at this film and tends to ignore Bergen\\'s slight lip movements. Charlie is the real personality of interest, not Edgar - here playing a hard working young man who would like to marry Vicki Whipsnade (Constance Moore) but is resigned that she wants to marry a wealthy young wastrel instead. Bergen could act (look at his performance in I REMEMBER MAMA, as Ellen Corby\\'s boyfriend/husband, and his comic scene there with Oskar Homolka regarding the dowry). But he did not have to act as Bergen here - all he had to do was let Charlie do his job (and, for that matter, let Mortimer Snerd do his work too in two scenes). The tricks used by the director to have scenes where Charlie appears without Bergan are just even more effective, as they enhance the idea of an independent comic personality coming out of the dummy.<br /><br />For Fields there are many choice moments too. His walk, supposedly naked after a shower, across the circus grounds - hidden behind people carrying items, or elephants and other animals, until a lady screams and faints (and Fields is finally physically revealed to the audience) is a gem. So is his wrecking the Bel-Goodies engagement party, first by his mad ping pong match, and then by his insistence of telling the story of how his life was saved once by an intelligent rattlesnake (not realizing that Mrs. Bel-Goody hates even the mention of snakes). His interactions with the circus staff, with the idiotic Grady Sutton, with labor union organizer Edward Brophy, and with the various people buying tickets for the circus, or for that matter mispronouncing his name as \"Larceny Whipsnake\" are priceless. So is his own attempt at ventriloquism: he does it so you can\\'t see his lips move, but you just can\\'t believe he is throwing his voice. Well he is throwing dust or something else at that moment.<br /><br />But it is his running confrontations with McCarthy, some of which he actually loses (he has one where he has to bribe Charlie at one point to keep quiet) that maintains the audience\\'s attention. The film is one of Fields\\' best ones, and deservedly retains it\\'s popularity to this day.',\n",

I admit I haven't read the book, but I am the sort of person who likes to judge adaptations on their own merits. The film does look phenomenal, the set design is intricately crafted and the costumes are beautiful. And the special effects are mind-blowing, not the best special effects ever but not the worst, far from it. The soundtrack is also rousing and fun, the story is intriguing, the script is decent and the acting is very well done. Both Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan(the better of the two) give appealing lead performances while Amy/Catherine Quinn is very cute as Lina's little sister Poppy. Bill Murray is deviously obnoxious as the slob of a mayor if there ever was one. However, despite the impressive visuals and performances, there are some problems. One is that while Tim Robbins is a good actor, he is given little to do as Doon's father. Second, the ending felt rather abrupt, the film could've done with a more rounded finish. Thirdly, the pacing is rather slow and drawn out at times particularly in the middle half. This is probably not helped by the occasionally sluggish direction.

Teddy Roosevelt and his rather diverse band of recruits believed that they were going to Cuba to save the Cuban people from an evil and exploitive Spanish colonial government. Tom Berenger completely buries himself in the character of Teddy Roosevelt without the parody that often accompanies the part. He is surrounded by a cast of excellent actors from Gary Busey as General Joe Wheeler to George Hamilton as William Randolph Hurst. Sam Elliot, Francesco Quinn, and Brad Johnson are fictional characters used to represent the range of ordinary men who followed Roosevelt. Chris Noth, Holt McCallany, and James Parke are the wealthy scions of the Wadsworth, Fish and Tiffany families. I especially liked Nick Chinlund as Frederick Remington and Adam Storke as Stephen Crane. Except for Hurst and Wheeler, these men went into the war dreaming of honor and adventure. They saw themselves as heroes going off to save the Cuban people. They were men who quoted Shakespeare\\'s Henry V \"we happy few\" and believed it implicitly.

The only reason is to be a part of your child's world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokemon, and by my showing an interest in what they like, we are closer. Seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube, and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience. I gave the movie a 4, mostly from my children's point of view.<br /><br />\",\n",
              "  b\"If you're going to watch a Jeff Chandler western, this is the one to see. I'd hestitate to call it a masterpiece, but it's a damn good try. Produced and directed by the team of Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, it is a tale of conflicting loyalties, megalomania, love, hate and a number of other issues I can't remember, in pre-Civil War Kansas on the eve of the Civil War. Star Jeff Chandler, who portrays the megalomaniacal but withal personally decent and charismatic bad guy, is quite good here. He had spent a decade in action pictures and romances, with an occasional comedy thrown in for good measure, and yet had not achieved major stardom. A mid-level star of the kind of medium grade movie that was going out of fashion, he was on the verge of becoming an anachronism; and had he not died a couple of years after this film one wonders what would have happened to him and his career. In The Jayhawkers he shows what he might have become: a fine, commanding, aristocratic character actor.<br /><br />As the second-billed good guy, Fess Parker, fresh from his triumph as Davy Crockett a few years earlier, was attempting a mainstream, post-Disney career. Low-key and phlegmatic, and not without appeal, he lacks the edge of a Mitchum that might have propelled him into the big leagues, and is for the most part an uninteresting hero. Nicole Maurey is the incongruously Gallic love interest, and one can't help be curious as to why she was cast in this film. She was a lovely young woman, but way out of place here.<br /><br />Loyal Griggs color photography is as good as his work in Shane, and far less mannered. The music of Jerome Moross is stirring and in its way as good as anything Dimitri Tiomkin ever did. With its larger than life good-bad guy, and reasonable (for a movie) historical accuracy, this could have been a major film. The problem with it is that though Panama and Frank were quite good at light comedy, they were inexperienced in the western genre. Frank does a good, derivative job of drawing from Ford and Hawkes; and there are some breathtaking vistas. There is even a touch of Nicholas Ray in his creative and interesting use of interiors, especially the main hideout. And Chandler gives an at times daring performance, with occasional lapses into mild effeminacy in his vocalizing and posture, his work is well-rounded and sophisticated, suggesting that his character's feeling for Parker is more than just friendship. Alas, this daring aspect of the story is never gone into with any depth or insight, and the result the movie is a near-miss, but a fascinating one.\",\n",
              "  b\"I am an avid fan of both Anthony Hopkins and Matthew Broderick. Why they chose to do this film is beyond me. While both turn out stellar performances they are wasted in a disjoint story which bounces between multiple subplots -- and it isn't clear which plot is the 'main' plot -- and dubious flashbacks. While sex is an integral component to some of the subplots, its depiction is gratuitous.<br /><br />The story wanders aimlessly and in the end comes crashing down in flames leaving this viewer burned out and wasted.\",\n",

              "  b\"Wow. I was really surprised when I saw this film tonight. I'd heard so much about it being such a masterpiece and one of the best films of 70s, that I knew I had to see it. Afterwards, I just have to assume that the rest of the films of the 70s were rotten for this to one of the best! Most of the reason I disliked this movie was that it seemed like every second was being created by someone with ADD,...perhaps even ADD as well as crack! That's because there are no quiet moments--only scenes where practically everyone is talking at the same time and it seemed like they were trying to cram 3000 minutes of film into one movie. And because of this, after a while I just wanted it to stop. While some might be amused by this, it just seemed overwhelming and annoying.<br /><br />It's funny--I have never liked Country music, but I really felt sorry for the people of Nashville because the movie seemed to paint them so poorly--like some sort of freak show. It seems that according to the writers, director and actors, the people of Nashville, and perhaps America of the 70s, is made up of dumb hicks.\",\n",

David Lloyd George (The British Prime Minister) and Douglas Haig (The General commanding the British Army) hated each other and after the war DLG got his memoirs into print very quickly - this led to the myth that the British Army was led by bungling officers and sacrificed for nothing.<br /><br />This show plays on that myth - In an extremely funny way. Alas - it also helps rob the British Army of its finest victory. <br /><br />Despite that I love this show - they visit so many of the controversial sides of this conflict in what is at times a side achingly funny way. The end is especially poignant.\",\n",

A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.\",\n",

              "  b'This was my second run at Oriental horror films and unlike the first try (some movie about spirals) I actually enjoyed this one. I have a hard time trusting anyone who says they knew the ending, it was pretty well disguised through most of the movie. In addition it was a unique blend of video game and movie. Things going against it were the colors and the fast-forward thing that both of the Japanese horror movies have had. I would highly recommend subtitles over the dubbed in English as the subtitles seem to make more sense and the dubbing gives the movie an undesired godzilla effect. A little on the artsy side but definitely accomplishes good suspense. 8/10 for an enjoyable time watching the movie.',\n",
              "  b'Decidedly adult-oriented slapstick-comedy, though it was originally marketed towards the younger crowds, that has two very different brothers (played by comedians Nathan Lane and Lee Evans) suddenly left broke and homeless directly resulting from a couple of disturbing and rather unfunny circumstances. By what seems like pure luck the bumbling brothers inherit a dilapidated mansion at just the right time from their wealthy industrialist father (played by William Hickey) who has just recently passed away. Apparently the house, as they soon find out, was built by some well-known architect in the mid-nineteenth century ultimately making it very valuable and highly sought-after by a number of collectors. In the process of attempting to clean the place up so as to hold a big auction in it with hopes of selling it to the highest and wealthiest bidder the two men realize (much to their dismay) that the house\\'s oldest resident, a tiny little mouse, is unwilling to give up his much loved abode without a fight! From that basic plot hilarity is supposed to ensue, but for a number of reasons it rarely does! One of the many things that bothered me about this flick and made it hard for me to laugh was the big fact that it was so dark, dank and just way too atmospheric for it\\'s own good. Meaning that the seemingly unnamed time-period and or place that it\\'s set in is far too unpleasant, grimy and gritty for an out-and-out comedy, let alone a kid\\'s film! In fact it kind of reminds me of the sometimes graphic and violent \"Delicatessen\" and \"The City Of Lost Children\"...dark and amoral, with a fairy-tale like theme and enormous and meticulous set designs. However, unlike those two films this one was inappropriately aimed towards children via the cartoon-like slapstick comedy reminiscent of the old \"Wily Coyote and The Road Runner\" and sorry but I gotta say it, \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons. Some curious cameos are also featured here from a number of character actors that are passable considering all, though to be honest I\\'m still scratching my head as to why any of them would have actually made appearances in this flick in the first place; the actors I\\'m in reference to are: Maury Chakin, Christopher Walkin (!?), the late Michael Jeter, the late William Hickey who passed away shortly after this film wrapped and who\\'s memory it is dedicated to in the end credits, and Vicki Lewis. Overall, \"Mousehunt\" is not the worst film you could ever see that\\'s for sure. However, in my opinion and this is just my opinion mind you, I don\\'t think that it\\'s really too fit for the kiddies out there frankly. Though, a number of the adult\\'s are likely to get a kick out of this to a degree more or less, but I don\\'t think that many of them will find it to be completely fall-down hilarious by any means.

              "  b\"I've read the reviews on this website and can only conclude that the two Johns involved with this movie (Travolta and Woo) must have paid a lot of people a lot of money to register with IMDb and write 10-star reviews to balance out the more valid 1 and 2-star reviews. This movie is absolutely atrocious in every aspect: directing, acting, special effects, dialog, plot-line, you name it. If Travolta were playing his role more tongue-in-cheek and the movie itself were touted as a comedy, then it might be palatable. But the movie and actor both appear to be actually taking themselves seriously, and the result is something that is just dreadful to watch. It took all my strength to actually see it through to the end all the while hoping that something redeeming would happen. It did not. Do not waste your time by seeing this movie. Use the two hours to weed your garden, mow your lawn, change the cat litter, or wash the windows. Any of those things are more enjoyable than sitting through this.\",\n",

We can all learn a lesson from Rocky. Cher, Eric Stoltz, and Sam Elliott were the perfect cast to tell this true story of Rocky, and they did an awesome job. Cher has stated that it was her favorite film to make, and Sam Elliott is sexier than ever. Eric, of course was wonderful as Rocky Dennis. The music used in the film is excellent and appropriate, Lynard Skynard, Springsteen, Bob Seagar, Little Richard, Steely Dan, and The Grateful Dead to name a few..

              "  b\"At first, I actually had no idea that Billy Blanks was an actor, but after seeing the poster for this film, my interest had been captured. I was treated to a really amazing beat 'em up fest. Billy Blanks and Roddy Piper sure know how to kick some butt.<br /><br />The movie centers around veteran police office Frank Rossi, played by Piper, who after his partner Wallace is brutally gutted by a ruthless drug gang, becomes bent on avenging his partner's death. Meanwhile, Billy (Played by Billy Blanks), an ex-Special Forces agent, is trying to protect his sister from the same gang, lead by Kasajian, played brilliantly by Nigel Bennett. Rossi and Billy eventually team up after a number of confrontations when Billy's sister and Rossi's reporter girlfriend Helen (Played by Bobbie Phillips) are kidnapped by Kasajian's gang.<br /><br />This movie really knows how to deliver. It's sad that there is really not that large of a following, but we can always hope that it will gain more cult recognition in the future. I hope Universal considers releasing a DVD of this movie someday, in widescreen.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />EXTRAS: The tape contains a trailer for Mr. Write (1994) before the movie starts.\",\n",
              "  b'Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class A western, except one: the story, that really belongs to a class B or C. That was acceptable at the time the film was made, when people were so thrilled to see a western in color, but nowadays it just looks very primitive. Nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns, it is entertaining, the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that recently came out.

A previous comment does a good job of pointing out the errors in the added period footage.<br /><br />It was a good introduction into a serial murderer I'd never heard of. It was also a disgusting overly dramatized exercise in attempting to concentrate more on the gross out factor than reporting the facts. Not content to describe once how good certain parts of a child's body were when roasted and eaten, it describes the heinous deeds in fact and again in a first person voice-over narrated by an actor playing Albert Fish.<br /><br />For shock affect it delved into ramming the details of his crimes down the throat of the viewer, again and again. At the expense of his victims and their families the film wallows in filth and was offensive in the extreme because of it. Either we're too stupid to digest the horror of his acts, or sales were forefront and above any other consideration the film makers claim.<br /><br />It's not a documentary. A documentary informs us of real events without trying to sicken people with fictitious scenes added catering to the director's opinion of what took place. That's fiction. It's not a movie, in a movie you can accept that 'based on' gives the director license to add whatever he thinks will sell. It is a sick perverted film on a sick perverted killer but that not being enough, it approaches the same type of sick twisted deeds on film, that Fish did in person. In this, the film makers succeed in showing their perverted intention on wringing out every last drop of human suffering in their own race for sales.<br /><br />Joe Coleman, obviously delighted to lay claim to notoriety by surrounding himself with the artifacts of the infamous and psychotic members of our society, sits smugly as he tells us he's thrilled to have the original letter sent to one victim's family, describing what Fish did to their child. How he was 'meant' to have it. Most serial murderers take trophies and this particular derelict of humanity, Coleman, does the same here, living with the material surrounding the worst part of themselves humanity has to offer. If any proof was needed for what I'm saying here, it's in the repeated interviews with this piece of crap. His sole participation in this film should have been only in examining this letter. Instead we're treated to repeated interview segments with no other reason than to try and help sell this presentation of crap.<br /><br />These flaws ruin what could have been a remarkable recounting of Fish's deeds. The makers of this prostituted themselves for sales and in doing so, reflect a watered down mirror of the same sort of sickness Fish succumbed to. It's a perverted reporting of a perverted person and because of this they have more in common with this man than they may want to realize.\",\n",

              "  b\"First off, I'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the Best Picture Academy Award was 'Gigi' in 1958. That is misinformation as 'West Side Story' won in 1962, 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music' won the year after that. That said, this film is absolutely fantastic! The story from the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version. However, I don't mind. In fact, I rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does. I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh. I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office. The underscore for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any film version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is worked out much better than he is in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest, most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy.' I always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs. It looks awful and cheesy, especially when they're dancing at the London Meat Co. They should've just done regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.\",\n",
              "  b'This exquisitely photographed film portrays the cultural clash between Europeans (in this case the Europeans happen to be French) and various native tribes in seventeenth century North America without romanticizing either French culture or that of the native peoples.<br /><br />Perhaps the most striking feature of this film from my perspective was utter arrogance of the Europeans to come into a wild country presuming the superiority of their way of life over that of the indigenous peoples. No character seemed to understand that better than Father LaForgue, admirably portrayed by Lothaire Bluteau. The good Father soldiers on despite the evidence that his presence in the vast wilderness of North America won\\'t make a whit of difference in his life or in the lives of the people he has vowed to introduce into \"paradise.\" The Algonquin guides worry about their attachment to the \"demon\" LaForgue and wonder whether they shouldn\\'t just kill him. Even LaForgue\\'s young assistant, Daniel, wonders how the presence of a French missionary makes the the native people\\'s lives any better. The Iroquois, who suffer from a harsh depiction in the film, take a more economically-based view of LaForgue -- he and Daniel are seen by the Iroquois as currency to be exchanged for guns.<br /><br />An aside concerning the Iroquois. While the violence depicted in the film is no doubt accurate, what the film does not reveal is that the Iroquois likely became decidedly more hostile when the French began to assist old enemies, such as the Algonquin, in traveling into hunting grounds that had previously been Iroquois territory.<br /><br />But back to LaForgue, whose journey is the primary emphasis of the film. He has journeyed, apparently from a life of some privilege in France, leaving behind a doting mother and (perhaps) a beautiful young woman. He has journeyed away from the \"pleasures of the flesh,\" lingering on the sight of a couple making love in the communal tipi and later admitting to Daniel that he, LaForgue, lusts after the young Alogonquin woman,Annuka, with whom Daniel had already struck up a sexual relationship. He gets lost on the journey in the cathedral-like forest and rejoices and being found by Algonquin hunters, who express some bemusement that the Black Robe got lost in the first place. Finally, he journeys to the Hurons and a village beset by smallpox, where baptism has been sold to the natives as a miracle cure as much as it has a key to salvation.<br /><br />By avoiding the tendency of films depicting Native American life to romanticize, Bruce Beresford has captured more profoundly the daily harsh realities of life for the peoples inhabiting the northeastern portion of North America at the arrivals of the first trickling of Europeans. Neither way of life is ultimately depicted as superior to the other: each simply is. This is not a \"feel-good\" film. Instead it is a realistic, thought-provoking tale of a journey of a man, of cultures, and of life itself. Simply a brilliant film.',\n",

But \"Of Mice and Men\" comes out very well done. In this adaptation of John Steinbeck\\'s novel, the two actors bring to life the retarded Lennie Small and the self-standing George Milton, respectively. On the farm where they get hired, one can easily see the hierarchy inherent in society: the workers forced to do the most degrading labor; the African-American ostracized from everyone else; the Chinese servant; and the woman (Betty Field) forbidden from having her own life. In the midst of everything, George has to look after Lennie, who proves very dangerous to himself and others.<br /><br />So, this is definitely a movie that I recommend.

I\\'m interested in certain notions of complex abstract reasoning, but the simpler, more obvious stuff is fun too. One of those \"simple\" things is national identity. And there is hardly a better case than how the British defined themselves during the great war. While France rolled over and most Europeans were left to define themselves as humans instead of citizens, the English really turned to film as a nation.<br /><br />One of the most interesting appropriations was Sherlock Holmes. He has a singular importance in the history of literature, both in terms of placing a discoverer of story in the story, and in terms of being a representative of the (then) new notion that people are motivated and act rationally.<br /><br />So any movie with Holmes in it, no matter how casual, is loaded, and this one is loaded by bulldozers. Holmes is transported from Victorian times to then modern times. His nemesis here is the guy who played his old opponent: Moriarty. <br /><br />And there are other transpositions as well. Holmes\\' interest in science is transformed to a focus on technology, here microfilm, high tech for the time. And the action \\xc2\\x97 after some homeland establishing shots (including a loving mother) \\xc2\\x97 is transported from the UK to the US. And that\\'s the interesting part, because when you are defining your nature, you have the choice by defining it against others.<br /><br />In this case, we have a parade of American stereotypes. Since it was absolutely clear that the Americans were saving the Brits from extinction, this is done with less edge than usual. But we still have the bullmoose loud senator, the dippy but earnest girlie, the solid naval officer and such. These are woven around landmarks of Washington.<br /><br />But one stereotype is particularly of interest. In the 40\\'s in the US, black men were railroad porters. By a lucky accident, it was a way to earn decent money, be relatively cosmopolitan but still stay in a role of servitude. These were Jim Crow days in the US, a bad time, a time of canker. So depicting the necessary black man in this film was handled with some sensitivity. The British filmmakers followed the form of polite deference, but with less bowing and scraping than in an America movie of the era. <br /><br />But check out who plays the black porter. He\\'s George Muse, perhaps the least servile black man in the business at the time, someone who would go on to earn a doctorate. Someone who refused to give an inch on basic respect. I think the Brits in charge of production, who did the US portions in California with DC projected on screens behind, would have been amused. The savior of the world, with this huge blot.<br /><br />Ted\\'s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.',\n",

              "  b'This is the first time I have written a comment on IMDb in all the years I have used it avidly to search for worthy videos to watch. I am writing it not because there is not enough comments already for this wonderful series, but to additionally help you decide if you should invest a whopping 54 hours of your life on watching one drama! Since this is aimed at convincing you why you should watch it, I will keep spoilers to a minimum.<br /><br />So how did I get involved with it? I was searching for worthy Korean TV series to watch after having seen the more contemporary setting drama such as Stairway To Heaven, which is highly recommended. When I came across this, although rated highly by others, I shy-ed away from it for the same reason above ... I just couldn\\'t imagine how this kind of drama can entice me. But...someone I know asked if I have it to lent them due to the fact I told people I watched Korean Drams. I did not in spite of my collection of top DVD titles. I decided to get it just to find out what it was all about. At the time, IMDb did not have this title rated to assist in my decision.<br /><br />Episode one was interesting. Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety. If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode 3, then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible). The actors/actresses are handsome/pretty, but that is not why I continued.<br /><br />The first set of DVDs I purchased was made in China and had OK English translation. The problem with the English translation, while subtle, surfaced more in the second half, as one can tell they are not done by the same person(s). An anal movie-buff that I am, I sold it and bought the YesAsia edition, more expensive but has much better translation (a very prominent example would be: Palace Girl in the China Edition is Court Lady in the YesAsia edition -- while Palace Girl is the \"literal\" translation, the proper equivalent by title is Court Lady). The picture quality is also better. In fact, my wife commented that Jang-Geum (grown up) is not as pretty as in the China version now that she can see the imperfections on her face close up.... So I ended up spending yet another 54 hours re-watching...but it was worth it...because the translation clarified things that otherwise would have been lost as \"cultural differences.\" This is the set that will remain in my library as one of the rare \"worthy\" TV dramas to collect in its original form. By the way, the China edition in the green box has bonus materials of interview with some of the cast members as well as the last 7 days of filming -- even though there is no English subtitle on the bonus materials, it was still quite enjoyable to see how the cast looked in \"modern\" attire and their reaction to the questions! :)<br /><br />With so many TV programs trying to \"buy\" an audience with \"sex, violence, and improper language (lack of respect)\" screen time nowadays, it is truly refreshing to see something that not only serves to entertain but also educate at the same time without emphasis on sex and violence! It is little wonder that this series has swept away audiences all over and realigned some of the younger generation to the ideals that seem to be eroding away in the modern world.<br /><br />In closing, none of the episodes disappointed and they were all enjoyable, but it is just a small few minutes here and there of extra details that seem to drag a bit in the first 10 episodes. In fact, I have a feeling that if you are KOREAN you will probably not feel the drag due to your ability to relate those details better than non-KOREANs like me.<br /><br />The quality of research that has gone into making this production (the cuisines and the medicines) is impressive and educational. The music - excellent. Combined with the singular vision of one director and one writer for this drama, it is a COMPLETE experience that, in short, will enrich the lives of anyone who is open-minded and willing to invest the time to watch it.<br /><br />Please let me know if my comment is helpful to you.

I expected it to provide a cinematic version of what I already knew of the Chun Li persona, and it failed to provide in every way.<br /><br />First off, Kristen Kreuk as Chun Li. What where they thinking! There are hundreds of highly skilled Asian actors that could have been casted in a better fashion. Bison/Balrog (lol confusing) kept reminding me of the Green Mile, the death sentenced good guy with a heart of gold. Now he is some buffed punchbag, mmm. This leads to the horrible, horrible accents that the actors had when they were talking in an Asian language. Seriously, UGH!.<br /><br />The story itself was shallow, bad bad special effects. (Spinning Bird Kick in the club scene, are you serious? 20 years ago they were able to make it look better in a video game. 30 years ago they made it look better in a Kung Fu movie, get real.<br /><br />The story about her revenge on Bison is shallow. She gets her revenge in a way, but it's not satisfying at all.<br /><br />Top it all off with cheesy one-liner upon one-liner, bad acting, bad casting and you got yourself a turdcake that the entire audience has to take a bite off.<br /><br />F--, see me after class.\",\n",

Saviour depicts this with astonishing realism and at times,is difficult to watch but I guess that what war is all about.

What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clich\\xc3\\xa9s in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.\",\n",

I\\'m not entirely sure if I\\'m happy with my decision... on one hand, the film is really, really bad, on the other, now I have another free tape... yeah, you get it. The plot is predictable and not in any way original. The pacing is bad. The acting is bad, but that\\'s not really surprising, seeing as the two leads are former soap-opera stars... they\\'re used to overact. The characters are poorly written clich\\xc3\\xa9s. The film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress me(through film): court scenes. Even those don\\'t elicit one single emotion for or against any of the cardboard-thin characters. The film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever... even the dialog is bad. The thing is, it\\'s so full of clich\\xc3\\xa9s that it\\'s laughable. And that\\'s the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 1/10: the(albeit unintentionally so) comic relief of the many clich\\xc3\\xa9s and stereotypes. I didn\\'t pay very much attention to the film, but just about every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. One final note: I considered using the line \"Tori Spelling can\\'t act\" as a one line summary, but I guess everyone knows that, so I opted for the current one, seeing as it\\'s more informative. All in all, a thoroughly bad film, but not the worst if you\\'ve got nothing else to do and if it\\'s on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it. 3/10',\n",

Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so inept, clich\\xc3\\xa9d and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow\\'s ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable.

Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick out of it.

              "  b'I saw Scrapple at the 1998 Breckenridge Film Fest. The description of the film read, \"Pigs, drugs, and ski bums.\" I was intrigued, to say the least, by what would be my favorite film of the festival.<br /><br />The opening credit scenes had me believing I was watching a movie that was filmed in the mid \\'70s. By the second scene I knew I was in for a great film. Having lived in ski towns for the past 10 years, I can safely say that Scapple does an outstanding job of relaying the universal, timeless truisms of ski town life.<br /><br />Entertaining, funny, and cinematically beautiful, the film sends a small message that hits close to home. During the story we fall in love with Al Dean, the king of blind luck, in his efforts to make things right.<br /><br />This is a film that was put together remarkably well, especially for a first time, independent project. After seeing a movie like Scrapple, one wonders how this film isn\\'t being distributed on a national level, when so many undeserving movies are. I suppose blame lies in the unenlightened viewing public and not in the quality of the film, as Scrapple is the most underrated film I have yet to see.<br /><br />Kudos to the Hanson brothers for their grassroots efforts to get this movie seen by appreciative moviegoers.',\n",
              "  b\"This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either. But some observations:<br /><br />1. If the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it is only a matter of lousy film-making, not giving a damn about being coherent.<br /><br />2. We don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully (=bombastically) delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext \\xc2\\x96 just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in.<br /><br />3. Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago \\xc2\\x96 and without needlessly humiliating his actors.<br /><br />4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary-schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondary-school level of skill.

Sofie Gr\\xc3\\xa5b\\xc3\\xb8l made toes crumble but not because of bad play but because the character she played was so embarrassing clumbsy.

              "  b\"Directed by Michael Winner and starring the late Charles Bronson in the lead role, this is a gritty inner city revenge film which comes off as a competent and effective social statement.<br /><br />Paul Kersey (Bronson) is a liberal architect living in a not so nice, crime ridden area of the city. He lives with his wife and daughter, who are brutally attacked whilst at home by 3 sadistic street trash thugs (a young Jeff Goldblum is one of them) whilst he is out. The wife is beaten into unconsciousness before later dying in hospital, and the daughter is sexually assaulted and goes into a catatonic state as a result of the shock.<br /><br />It is this terrible event which changes Kerseys perception of law and order. He starts to change his way of thinking, starts to change his way of acting. He sees an overstretched police force struggling with the city's crime and social decay, and feels he, just one man, can make a difference. Kersey soon enough takes to the streets, never to look for trouble, but to let trouble come to him, and deal with it directly in his own way! He is tired of being the decent citizen who shakes their head at the morning paper, talks amongst friends but does nothing to change what he sees. The film becomes better still as the police find themselves under pressure with the recent vigilante killings, and the media report that once helpless victims are fighting back against their attackers inspired by this new rebel.<br /><br />This is one of those films that has had a lasting effect on me, and I remember being quite shaken after watching it. It seems so real as Kersey could just as easily be a next door neighbour or uncle, he is no hulking giant with an arsenal of weaponry or superpowers, no fearless warrior who can't be scratched...he is just another man trying to make a living. Cleverly directed, well acted and graphic when it has to be, this is a great film and serves its purpose well. Gripping, raw and impactive, this is one of Bronson greatest films, and stands as a classic.\",\n",
              "  b\"One of the major problems with being a film fan, or a British film fan for that matter, is the deep sense of embarrassment whenever a new British film is released, because it's almost always bad. But alas, this is not the case with Michael Winterbottom's fascinating Wonderland. Here Winterbottom has gone back to the roots of the Ken Loach, Mike Leigh genre of kitchen-sink drama, crossing it with the narrative feel of Robert Altman, and the free-from style of Lars von Trier, creating in the process a new and deeply affecting tale of three south London sister over the course of one weekend (three days). The great thing about this is, briefly, for the course of the film anyway, British cinema has it's own identity. The BIG brit films of the last few years have all been tired American knock-offs, from Guy Ritchie's pathetic lock-stock and Snatch, to the empty romanticised views depicted in films like Four Wedding and Notting Hill. Wonderland gives an authentic view of London, without the glamour but with much more pathos, and fully developed characters. <br /><br />The ensemble cast of rising character actors are perfectly put together, they may not be familiar to some audiences even in the UK, but the work of the three female leads, McKee, Parker and Henderson are given fine support from the men, Ian Hart, John Simm and David Fahm. The cinema-verite style gives the film a strong realism, making some the more depressing scenes almost un-watchable, but Winterbottom and writer Laurence Coriat should be commended for trying something different within the confines of the ever-predictable British Film Industry (\\xc2\\x99). It sadness me that this film is so underrated, whilst average films like Billy Elliot gather a barrage of Oscar and Bafta nominations, I don't remember Wonderland getting a mention. This is by far the best British film I've seen in a long time, not a perfect film by any means, one flaw would be that some of the characters are pushed to the background, never getting a chance to fully shine, but a film this good is a rare thing. See it now you won't regret it. 9/10<br /><br />\",\n",
              "  b'Greetings again from the darkness. Much anticipated, twisted comedy from writer/director Richard Shepard is a coming out party for Pierce Brosnan the actor. That Bond guy is gone. This new guy is something else entirely!! Have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, \"Facilitator\" ... and is anything but pretty! Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear is the straight guy to Brosnan\\'s comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. Hope Davis has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear\\'s wife (what\\'s with her name \"Bean\"?) who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room.<br /><br />The visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, racetrack and Denver suburb.

              "  b'It really doesn\\'t matter that Superman comic books are unbelievably naive and their target is ten year old. What matters is that \"Superman Returns\" is bad movie. <br /><br />In the beginning,a question for You Dear Readers, how many of You actually believe that Superman will be defeated by bald Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Just as I thought. No spoilers here. So let\\'s get to some major issues right now.<br /><br />Firstly, this movie looks like commercial (scene in the bar with Superman/Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is only scene which looks as it supposed to). Imagine commercial of Superman, two and half hour long. Let\\'s be serious this isn\\'t \"Amadeus\" or \"The Departed\". You actually feel, that this movie is way too long. And special effects are not so special by the way.<br /><br />Secondly, scenario is silly. Sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic, in cinema it looks just stupid. And it\\'s like that in this case. Of course dialogs are disgrace. I can\\'t believe somebody took money to write them. How many times we will be fed with villain making speeches? How many times laws of physics will be raped? (Jesus, it\\'s not only the matter of Superman\\'s strength but also a resistance of materials his dealing with.) How many times Lois Lane will be fooled by Kent? How many times Hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books? Since there\\'s hard to make a good story, why having a weak story for a starter? It just doesn\\'t work. Guys, get a grip. Try harder, please. Or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. I got the feeling that WGA is permanently on strike. No offense. I\\'m not questioning the lame money those people are paid, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case there is no quality at all. (At this point You may ask yourself: is it that bad? Yes it is.)<br /><br />Thirdly, acting is weak, which is quite a surprise since Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects) is directing. Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he\\'s the only one. Audience is rather not in the mood for jokes. Thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality, with clear motivations but also with doubts, fears, some depth. In this case nobody did that job, and characters aren\\'t really interesting.<br /><br />Finally, whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody. Second unit is so bad that attracts attention, since there\\'s nothing interesting going on on screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), the funnier it gets (but it isn\\'t laugh You could expect).<br /><br />Final conclusion?

RAWHIDE is a great example and contains many reasons for its general obscurity.<br /><br />Things go wrong the moment Susan Hayward arrives on the scene. This woman cannot act and her character is completely overbearing and obnoxious.<br /><br />This is simply a badly written story made worse by bizarre performances by Hugh Marlowe, Dean Jagger, George Tobias and the thoroughly freakish Jack Elam who is either the highlight or the low-light of the film.<br /><br />Jack Elam gives all to his role with his eyes bugging out, licking his lips and his teeth, sticking out his tongue and his jaw and positioning his head in every freakish position that he can. And he gets close-ups! All he needed was to have his head spin around a la Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST.<br /><br />Hugh Marlowe is awful and doesn't seem to realize he is in a movie.<br /><br />Dean Jagger mutters much of the time as the semi-simpleton of Marlowe's band of gold robbers.<br /><br />George Tobias plays an ethnic in the manner of El Brendel, yet looking like Alfonso Bedoya in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.<br /><br />Tyrone Power does the best of all with a cookie-cutter character.<br /><br />On the other hand, the location shooting in Lone Pine is very attractive and the digital restoration made the image quality look near to real life, but in black and white.<br /><br />I can't envision myself ever watching this grueling film again.\",\n",

I don\\'t think it is well done as a movie or that it shows in anyway the reality of a country like Colombia which, constantly improves and shows to be winning the fight against terrorism and drug dealers. I also find it extremely utopic and epic, yet it is your choice to watch it or not. The whole movie revolves around friendship, but it shows a lot more than that.

I won't give a synopsis of the movie as others have always done it adequately. I won't liken it to other movies as it stands quite clearly on its own. Transgressing shock horror and mutilations for the fear of what cant be seen, and that resides not only in the woods alone. I love the way the woods intruded on the school with vines and leaves on the walls and the floor. And the leaves always present on the teachers hair. Patricia Clarkson does a beautifully understated job as the headmistress, and her quiet voice doing a lot more to scare me than a lot of yelling and overbearing attitudes of other films. Agnes is great as the Heroine Heather, and I found myself totally captivated by her style. Her friend Marcy was a lovely touch and the vocals for the part (whether her or not) were stunning. The stillness was also an attraction, never hurrying, like trees, still and composed. I am enamored by the atmosphere, the cinematography, and the set design and I don't know if the director can better this but I do hope he gives it a try.\",\n",

This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with Lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home.

Demonic Toys, Wax Works and all of the Puppet Masters are so lame now. Even though years before I was terrified!!!! It's really weird 2 look back on all the things that scared u when u were younger, and look at them now. All I can do is laugh at this corny crap! It's just so weird. It was around the time that killer dolls were frighting. But Chucky is still watchable. He's still somewhat creepy I guess, but now it's nothing but good old humor!! I do however suggest that u rent this film or even buy it if u want 2 watch a comedy. It should be fun 2 sit around with friends and laugh at this movie. Besides that the plot was awful and the effects were useless, u could find something good about it if u look hard enough. But me? Absolutely not, I still can't believe this use 2 give me goose bumps!\",\n",

My Favorite actor in Subway Stories actually was Danny Hoch. I\\'m not even sure why, I think it was because he was cool and laid back. Where as his friend was very hype kind of rowdy and a little drunk. But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well. I also think it was the best story out of all ten stories, which is called \"HONEY GETTER\". The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting. I checked out all the scenes where the stories were shot, and it kind of Felt as if I was in the movie it self, feeling weird like I was in my own little world. Another thing I did was went to the spot where the movie first comes on from the blimp look. It took me a while to find it but I finally did, and the spot that they show or I should say the view is just right above Union Square. Because if you look real carefully at your tv, you\\'ll notice the foot locker and the dirt on the side which I believe now is a movie theatre called United Artists. Well that pretty much concludes my little story and I enjoyed sharing, I hope maybe you\\'ll notice something in the movie I didn\\'t.

              "  b'The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clich\\xc3\\xa9s. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br /><br />The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri\\'s seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man\\'s impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film\\'s conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en\\'s surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en\\'s poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br /><br />Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90\\'s. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br /><br />Score 10/10',\n",
              "  b'I love Westerns. I could watch them all day. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is my all time favorite. I watched \"Silverado\" for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst Western I have ever watched. The acting was terrible all around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing. The only good part I can think of is the good-looking cantina girl. The very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length. This movie wasn\\'t even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store. I felt like I was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing. Only reason I finished it was because I hate to not see a movie through to the end. I turned it off half way through because it was so bad. To the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to Westerns.',\n",
              "  b'This is a CGI animated film based upon a French 2D animated series. The series ran briefly on Cartoon Network, but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people I know going \"Huh?\" This is the story of Lian-Chu, the kind heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brains of the operation, who along with Hector their fire farting dragon,he\\'s more like a dog. Travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid. Into their lives comes Zoe, the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind. It seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes. In desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe of course tags along...<br /><br />What can I say other then why is this film hiding under a rock? This is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely Oscar contender. Its a beautifully designed, fantastic looking film (The world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures) that constantly had me going \"Wow\" at it. The English Voice cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I\\'ve ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is first rate. Equally great is the script which doesn\\'t talk down to its audience, using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films (not Disney nor Pixar). Its all really well done.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No, some of the bits go on too long, but at the same time its is damn entertaining.<br /><br />If you get the chance see this. Its one of the better animated films from 2008, and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009.',\n",
              "  b'A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy/Canada 1977).<br /><br />Every once in a while, you come across a film that really touches a nerve. This one offers a very simple premise, almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It\\'s surprising Ettore Scola\\'s \"Una giornate particulare\" is relatively unheralded, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it \\'rubbish\\' and Leonard Maltin, somewhat milder, \\'pleasant but trifling.\\' I disagree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I\\'ve seen. The cinematography is distinctly unflashy, even a bit bland, and the storyline straightforward, which might explain the film\\'s relative unpopularity. Considering late \\'70s audiences weren\\'t exactly spoiled with great Italian films, it\\'s even stranger this one didn\\'t really catch on with the critics.<br /><br />The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive footage from Hitler\\'s visit to Italy on may 8th 1938. Set against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building. One day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbour Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies. He is well-mannered, cultured and soon she is attracted to him. During the whole film, we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. After the opening scene, the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist (hypermodern at the time) apartment block, seemingly searching for our main characters, whom we haven\\'t met yet. <br /><br />Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles, all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren\\'s husband, but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I figure his voice must have been dubbed, since he\\'s not of Italian descent and never lived there, to my knowledge, so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian. If his voice has been dubbed, I didn\\'t notice at all. On the contrary, he\\'s completely believable as an Italian, even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are outstanding, the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn\\'t come off as overly pretentious but works completely. Don\\'t miss out on this one.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 9/10',\n",

              "  b\"Perhaps the first south Asian film that has had such a lasting impression on me, Khamosh Pani has hardly received the glory it truly deserves. Watching the film leaves you senseless for about half an hour and then it knocks all the wind out of you.<br /><br />Khamosh Pani takes the viewer to a small village in Pakistan where life evolves. Specifically it focuses on Ayesha and her son Saleem and their relationship. Ayesha never goes to the village well to draw water while Saleem gets seduced by Islamic fundamentalists and transforms from a love sick puppy to the man he thinks he wants to be.<br /><br />Sabiha Sumar, perhaps one of the best directors in the subcontinent, tells us the story of a small village in Pakistan. With perhaps one of the most powerful issues to deal with, Sumar displays true genius by making everything seem so subtle and hauntingly real. Perhaps, the greatest strength lies in convincing the audience that the statement need not be made in black and white and in this respect Sumar shines.<br /><br />To say that the acting performances were excellent would be the understatement of the century. One watches in amazement at how real and authentic each character is. The mind knows that what it sees are actors and yet it refuses to believe what it knows. Every single character, from an extra to the leads adds to the tremendous energy that the film brings with it. Kirron Kher as Ayesha/Veero is stunning, so much so that one cannot imagine her as anyone else. Aamir Ali Malik is another actor who plays with the audience, seducing them and disturbing them through the course of the film As an Indian separated from the partition by two generations I can't really say that I feel the pain that my mother does when she sees a film such as this, I have heard stories of my grand aunt who was attacked and mutilated by a mob in Lahore when my mothers family had to leave for India. Perhaps my lack of sentimental attachment makes me see it a little more objectively. Khamosh Pani has exposed me to some of this pain and while it may not be my own I can feel it. But the question that arose in my mind is that those that were around when this bloodshed (on both sides) occurred have mostly died or are dying, will we succeeding generations ever know this pain? The pain of leaving behind a wife, killing your own daughter, leaving her to be raped, Living in another country when that which was once a part of you lives somewhere else. How can I fight for this when I don't know what its like? Khamosh Pani made me feel this pain for a few days; perhaps we need more reminders such as these so that we can experience the pain to forget.\",\n",

The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle.

It\\'s not perfect, parts of it are quite flawed, but as a whole, even the flaws are beautiful gems to behold, and I tell you, for every voice barking on about Heavy Metal\\'s flaws being too much to take, I say this: you take your Saw and remakes of Texas Chainsaw and The Omen and whatever else your fetid college brains latch onto as broken things that need fixing, and we\\'ll take Heavy Metal and the original versions of the horror movies mentioned and be artistically far richer. But you\\'re not after richness in art, are you? You\\'re after eye-candy and digitally rendered starscapes, aren\\'t you? Yes, you are. And you\\'re beggars with moldy bread because of it.<br /><br />Heavy Metal is a classic, and I\\'ll be first to admit that it\\'s got problems, but believe it or not, problems sometimes add to a classic\\'s being considered a classic in the first place.

Then you also should avoid this one, because it's so utterly bad that it's not even funny. The movie's plot circles around illegal, underground street-arena fights where the fighters use many kinds of brutal weapons and kill each other. Sound familiar? This has been done many times, but never as bad as this. Most of the fighters are really unfit and shabby people, and there aren't much that reminds me of true martial arts skills.

Between the interviews we are shown interesting footage of the topic discussed, for example on resource exploitation you might see modern agriculture at work. The mood of the movie is also set by rather dramatic music, which clearly emphases that these issues are important and have to be taken seriously.<br /><br />The movie is not only about experts telling us about the situation today, but you also get to see \"normal\" people that have an opinion about the subjects in the movie, like the Chinese businessman and his take on resource exploitation as well as global warming or why not the workers from waste centers in Nigeria.<br /><br />All in all this movie covers many interesting topics in a dramatical way.

(Many of these appear to be non-Americans.) American have tended to judge the film for its story-telling qualities which are sadly lacking.) Unfortunately for Pollack, his masterpiece work \"Three Days of the Condor\" is a terribly hard act for anyone to follow, especially for its director who is competing with himself in this genre. \"The Interpreter\" does not fare well in this comparison.<br /><br />What was going on in this film? Sean Penn is a federal agent with an improbable and bizarre personal life (his dancer spouse is a runaway wife who dies in a car wreck with her lover...?) There there is all sorts of halting, non sequitur dialogue between Penn and Kidman that seems to hint at a romantic development but goes nowhere.<br /><br />The plot turns were all contrived and some of the action was incomprehensible -- why didn\\'t the agents get off the bus when told to? Why did they keep saying they didn\\'t want to expose their cover until they were blown to bits? It was one of many inexplicably odd plot devices that were counterintuitive. Much of this film was so contradictory it nearly gave me a headache.<br /><br />Movies are fiction, sleight of hand and fantasy but they have to be believable within their own context. \"Condor\" was brilliant in that it was believable within itself. Robert Redford was a thoroughly believable CIA analyst with a background that allowed him to elude assassination while developing a believable relationship with Faye Dunaway whom he kidnapped at random to aid his escape.<br /><br />I\\'ll simply fast-forward to the \"The Interpreter\\'s\" outrageously unrealistic ending which I will not reveal. I\\'ll simply ask viewers to compare it to the delicious twist at the end of \"Condor\" in which Redford is given fatherly advice by his own would-be assassin after the killer was instead ordered to murder the man who wanted Redford dead.<br /><br />\"Condor\" had a hard and realistic edge to it that is missing in \"Interpreter\".<br /><br />As for the political message of \"Interpreter\" regarding the UN, it seems one could see the film as arguing for and against the trouble-plagued international body. As a political message, Pollack\\'s film seems as confused as its plot.',\n",
              "  b'I was a bit hesitant about renting out \"Red Dwarf\" the first time one of my friends recommended it too me but I got it out anyway because I always like finding a new fantastic show, and this was definitely all that and more. While in the early series having a tiny budget used on props and the sets it still managed to produce fantastic story lines and new characters every episode, it was when they got a bigger budget(Season 3 or 4 and over) that they really let their creative style loose going to different funny dimensions, meeting equally funny new character\\'s and with jokes about what different dimensions existed they still had great character jokes, which really made the humour of this show something to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The character\\'s in the show are a great example of how character interaction alone can make a show 100 times better, and in this we see such a wide range of character\\'s, lead and co starring that make this show great on its own even without all the other dimensions (This was, as I said earlier most of what the first 2 or 3 seasons were like). First there is Dave Lister, who is a slob but is also a deep down very caring and compassionate guy and to the writers credit, they really make it so that just when you think Dave is just a useless slob they write an episode which reveals more about that character and how he is really a good guy. Then there is Rimmer, and prude sort of fellow who has always wanted to become an officer but, not being able to, due to being a complete incompetent worker and a general nuisance to be around has convinced himself that he is a great worker, but has not been promoted due to being so good at what he does (Head Vending Machine Maitenence man). Anyway, as the series progresses he is one of the best walls to bounce jokes with between him and Lister, and while they are always fighting deep down they both don\\'t hate each other and Lister is actually quite understanding of the fact that Rimmer is a complete and utter Smeghead. After that there is Kryten, one of my favourite character\\'s in a TV show in the 20th centuries, from him trying to be more human to his pathetic whining he is another great wall of jokes with all the character\\'s. Last of the main character\\'s from the early seasons (Kochanski replacing Rimmer for a small time in season 7) is the obnoxious but oddly lovable Cat, who is a descendant from a cat Lister smuggled aboard (Which is the reason Dave was put into stasis and how he became the only human alive) who has now become a human looking and sounding up himself cat mutant who has an odd addiction to fashion. All these character\\'s make the show what it is and what it always will be.<br /><br />Overall the time has become a classic that will (Hopefully) live on forever bringing in new waves of followers. Red Dwarf Forver!!!.',\n",

Words cannot express how terrible this movie is. I don\\'t care how bad that J. Lo movie \"Gigli\" is, it will not hold a candle to this waste of matter for pure crappiness. Dolph Lundgren is a marine -(who apparently is the only member of the entire US armed forces who can fly a stealth fighter in footage lifted from another crappy Dolph movie)- that must go board a sub in Russia so that some chemical weapon that the Russians stole from the Americans during the cold war can come back to the US. On board is Dolph\\'s \"ex-fiance\", who aside from looking like a reject from a Ron Jeremy movie, is also possibly the worst actress to ever set foot on the planet. I had to look up this \"actress\" to see what other suckers have hired her for movies and found out two things.... 1. thankfully, she\\'s not \"in demand\" and 2. Her shoddy acting is eclipsed only by her amazing spelling; I think her name is \"Melanie\" but it looks like some sort of indecipherable mumbo jumbo the way it is spelled. Anyway, I\\'m off track... this movie is pure crap.. not even one of those \"watch with your friends after some herbal refreshment\" movies... Everything from the recycled (and butchered) storyline of terrorists on a sub, where every possible cliche is used (and screwed up) to the awful performances, to the terrifyingly bad dialogue. This is the kind of movie that I think can be used as a torture device.

Nobody gets out of New York alive, it would seem; even the President of the United States... unless Plissken can haul his fat out of the fire. En route to the Chief Executive (\"President of what?\" Plissken asks at one point), there are downed planes and starving crazies who live in the sewers and old acquaintances hiding out in libraries and The Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes), whose army of ne\\'er do wells must be contended with. All within the allotted time: Plissken is literally a ticking time bomb, thanks to duplicitous Lee Van Cleef as the commander of the United States Police Force. For all its dark doings, however, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is also infused with an often subtle black humor that helps keep it from devolving into the kind of lackluster action film that features stars who can\\'t act; Russell as Plissken is also- surprise- vulnerable, and thence more real, than most action leads. One can\\'t help but sympathize with his character. (And one can\\'t help but think back to ELVIS, the amazing boob-tube biography directed by Carpenter with Russell in the lead: like ELVIS, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK delivers on an emotional level.

A bunch of high recognition celebrity voices are drafted for inane banter pasted over some stock footage of penguins wandering around the Antarctic, apparently seeking mates (or so we are told). Interspersed are some random shots of other animals touching themselves, again with sub-moronic observations by the voice-overs. Samuel L.

              "  b\"There were three things I liked about this movie: Francis McDormand, Natasha McElhonne, and the music (which even at times was in the contrived hipster-vein). I've always argued that Christian Bale, while he chooses interesting projects and, on the whole, good movies, is not a very versatile actor. When you replace Willem Dafoe, Micheal Ironside, Emma Watson, and Micheal Caine with Kate Bekinsale, this shortcoming is apparent. Kate Bekinsale is ridiculous in this movie. I rarely see acting this awkward. The two of them combine to make the least interesting pair I've ever seen. Bekinsale's side story revolves around some ridiculous research of Drosophila. The unrealism comes in when the audience is supposed to believe that someone is writing their Ivy League thesis about the fruit fly. People do this type of thing in undergrad at LSU. A friend of mine told me that I simply don't understand the movie or the lifestyle it portrays because I'm not from LA. I can't buy into this because Mulholland Drive is easily my favorite movie. Lynch is able to convey to his audience the California-way with much more intelligence, and that's barely even a story.\",\n",
              "  b'Few films have had as much nonsense written about them as Ernst Lubitsch\\'s \"Design For Living.\" From the moment it was released, it was criticized for rewriting Noel Coward\\'s then-daring play (Ben Hecht, the screenwriter, said: \"There\\'s only one line of Coward\\'s left in the picture--see if you can find it!\"); for casting Americans in parts that had originally been played by Coward, Alfred Lunt, and Lynn Fontanne; for toning down the gay subtexts of Coward\\'s play. All that is, of course, completely irrelevant; the question is not whether the play is faithful to the source material, but whether it\\'s good. And it is, it is.<br /><br />There are flaws in the film. This was one of the first times Lubitsch had made a movie with little or no music on the soundtrack; previously, in his musicals and his sublime \"Trouble In Paradise,\" he had used background music to cover up potential dead spots and carry the film along. Here there is none of that, with the result that some of the early scenes seem oddly paced. But the wit of the script (written by Hecht but, as always with Lubitsch, carefully supervised and contributed to by the director himself) and the appeal of the performers (more about them later) pull the film through the occasional rough spots, and the second half of the movie is just about perfect.<br /><br />Another idiotic thing that is often said about \"Design For Living\" is that Lubitsch and Hecht rewrote Coward due to fear of the censors. In fact, the censors must have had a heart attack when they saw \"Design,\" for this is one of the most sexually frank of the pre-Code Hollywood movies; premarital sex, cohabitation, adultery and frigidity are all clearly portrayed-- but, as always with Lubitsch, they are implied rather than shown. Lubitsch\\'s trademark door and blackout gags are here, and they are hilarious; again, it\\'s not Noel Coward--it\\'s Lubitsch, the cinema\\'s greatest comic filmmaker at the peak of his powers.<br /><br />But there\\'s something else here that isn\\'t found in most Lubitsch films, and it comes from Ben Hecht, whose cynical, fast-talking, very American style of writing gives the characters a flavor quite unlike the more Continental wit of Lubitsch\\'s usual heroes. (This is also one of the few Lubitsch films where the lead characters are American rather than European.) Critics have sometimes complained that Hecht\\'s somewhat inelegant style was unworthy of either Coward or Lubitsch. Again, I disagree; the moments of Hechtian farce (like the hilarious party scene) are beautifully handled by Lubitsch and turn the film into a forerunner of screwball comedy, the place where Continental charm and hard-driving Americanism meet.<br /><br />Now to the actors. The \"British is Better\" attitude of many critics made it inevitable that Lubitsch\\'s American cast would be pilloried. Again, this is not Noel Coward and a Noel Coward style of acting wouldn\\'t work in this context. All the leading players are actually quite wonderful: Miriam Hopkins, one of Lubitsch\\'s favorite actresses, has the best role and gives a marvelously energetic performance as the flighty, pretentious free spirit who tries to substitute art for sex; Gary Cooper is at the height of his youthful charm, with a surprisingly light comic touch and great teamwork with Fredric March. March, who can often be heavy-handed in film comedy, is here charming and funny; it\\'s a tribute to Lubitsch that he got such a genial performance out of him. And, of course, there\\'s Edward Everett Horton, one of Hollywood\\'s finest character actors in one of his finest roles.<br /><br />If you know and love the Noel Coward play, don\\'t expect this movie to be a faithful adaptation. Think of it as an original work of comedic art that happens to utilize some of the story elements of Coward\\'s play. It\\'s not Noel Coward; it\\'s a splendid romantic farce that, like all great comedies, has serious themes underneath the fun: Sexual freedom, male vs. female roles in society, art, love, friendship. So see it (if you can; it\\'s not on video, alas). It\\'s not Noel Coward, it\\'s Ernst Lubitsch, and despite the occasional flaws, it\\'s Lubitsch at his best.',\n",

The wigs didn\\'t bother me at all actually. Overall I thought the whole production seemed quite serious and it looked good to me and didnt detract from the movie.<br /><br />The thing that puts this movie down is the script and directing. It\\'s absolutely terrible. And I\\'m not kidding here. It seems like something I wrote back in fourth grade. And the way they try to put humour into it.

There\\'s no red line connecting it at all. I\\'ll admit it gave me a few laughs but that was mostly due to the horses having so short legs making them look ridiculous when they galloped.

              "  b'This film has caught me off guard a few times. At first I thought Samir Horn(Don Cheadle) was trying to infiltrate the terrorist organization who are suicide bombers that believes in something like the Qur\\'an by earning there trust, but later it seemed that he was actually loyal to the terrorist organization or even a double agent. And thought it would show the film in the terrorist point of view from the main character, which probably wouldn\\'t have sit right with most Americans. But later it is revealed that he does work for a organization that is trying to take down the terrorist group leader Nathir and get a hold of the terrorist plans. Even while playing this guessing game, I didn\\'t feel cheated because it was well crafted and gave some clues. I found the whole premise of Samir going to prison in order to befriend Omar who is a member of the terrorist organization a bit over the top, but there is way more over the top stuff that happens in these types of genres. I found the joke about how the suicide bombers are on a mission to get laid with 72 virgins pretty funny. Since it is pretty much the truth, but the film shows that not every people that believe in Allah are bad people and even the revealing of Samir\\'s past shows this, who is also a firm believer in Allah. In fact I didn\\'t necessarily hate Samir or Omar, even if Omar is a real terrorist for some reason. Maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous, although being courageous isn\\'t necessarily a good thing. So basically agent Roy Clayton investigates a dangerous international conspiracy responsible for a prison break in Yemen, a bombing in Nice and a raid in London. And all clues seem to lead back to a former U.S Special Operations officer, Samir horn. But soon contradictory evidence emerges, forcing Clayton to question whether his suspect is a disaffected former military operative or something more complicated, like the movies tagline. I was expecting some flashy fast paced spy movie but it turned out different from what I expected in that, it has some good drama to go with the action in fact the film has more drama than action. The first hour of \"Traitor\" was simply great, but after the first hour it started to lose it\\'s entertainment value and became a bit tedious. The parts after the first hour wasn\\'t bad, but just wasn\\'t good as the first hour of the film which kept me guessing. After the first hour, things start to get predictable, not that I knew what the ending was going to be or Samir\\'s last plan, but I knew what direction it is going. The stupid character decisions that jeopardize the mission got a bit irritating as well, it just seemed illogical and irrational. It was a decent espionage thriller with few glitches to sum it up.<br /><br />7.4/10',\n",
              "  b'\"Unhinged\" is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It\\'s hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. It\\'s plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins. <br /><br />As far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. NONE of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the \"lead\" girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven\\'t seen before. However, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. It comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic \"Sleepaway Camp.\" Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act. It may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end, but I say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes. 4 out 10',\n",

The main characters weren't all that compelling but the two comic relief friends Diggs (Tadhg Murphy) and Henry (Laurence Kinlan) did manage to get a few good lines in. The movie had its share of plot holes (quite a few of these were pretty big.) <br /><br />But on the whole I did find it funny and I was smiling by the end so it wasn't too bad, just nothing to write home about. I felt it tried a little too hard to fit with what are usually American high school stereotypes and could have been a little more homegrown.

              "  b\"My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece.<br /><br />Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again.<br /><br />The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.<br /><br />The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.<br /><br />The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.<br /><br />If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.<br /><br />Never the less, I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest Reguards.<br /><br />10/10\",\n",
              "  b'Based on the trailers, I was dreading seeing this film, as it looked like a shallow dull romantic movie with a \"clever\" twist in the form of the time traveller. However, I was very pleased to find, within ten minutes of the film starting, that it was clear that I was wrong; it was a very complex movie, looking at various problems/blessings that the main character\\'s condition meant. The first part of the film obviously introduced the titular character, his condition, and the love interest. This was done very cleverly, as she had known him for many years, but it was the first time he had met her. This is because it was an older version of him that travelled back to her childhood and earlier years. This broken timeline continues throughout the whole film, meaning that it could have easily been an incoherent muddle, but the director has controlled things carefully; sometimes following the traveller\\'s timeline, so everyone around him changes age suddenly; sometimes following everyone else\\'s timeline, so the traveller appears to suddenly age/become younger. The plot was kept on a low level; no one has to save the world in this film; it\\'s just about a couple trying to live a normal life given the bizarre condition the husband has. The time travelling is played to various effects throughout the story; there are a few scenes of comedy, some extremely touching emotional scenes, and some genuine shocks. good few plot twists come as a surprise, at times drastically changing the tone of the movie, but never coming across as contrived. While there is little to no action to keep you entertained, the characters are certainly interesting enough to keep you in this movie, with the entire cast playing their parts perfectly; most importantly, everyone acts realistically, no over-blown dramatic reactions. The people I saw this with have read the book, and some changed were made to the plot, but based on what I was told, the film\\'s interpretation of the plot is far better; certain events omitted did not belong in the story in my opinion, and cutting them out made the lasting impression of the film far less depressing. 9/10.',\n",
              "  b\"The comic banter between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. Powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's, and Arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells. They are extremely fun to watch, so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. Eric Blore also has some comic turns as Powell's butler.<br /><br />Powell's contract with MGM included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio, but he wanted to work again with Arthur and he liked the script, so he eagerly accepted the assignment. They had worked together in two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.\",\n",
              "  b'The name De Mille evokes big sets, big costumes and bigger action and Crusades was his follow up to his earlier take on Christian oration from the scandalous - in a good way - Sign of the cross. Henry Wilcoxson, his Marc Anthony of Cleopatra and the always beautiful Loretta Young team up in this extravagant epic. King Richard the Lionheart is not a Christian and is not faithful to the ways of the sign of the cross but to escape a forced marriage he signs up for the Crusades to free the holy city of Jerusalem. Of course, there is scheming behind his back to seize his throne while he is gone. Along the way he trades for a wife, Loretta and haggles and argues with his other European leaders. Now, it has often not be said for it is almost as if De Mille build big sets and big stories to tell little moments for all his excess, his movies are ridiculously dialogue driven, even by the standards of the other expensive blockbuster-type movies made back then. De Mille loved dialogue scenes and focusing on character. Very strange. And this movie is really a politics and character movie as the future of Europe is argued and royal pompous exposed. The action sequences are obvious studio sets but well shot. The final moments have good heart that is not forced but earned. Thus, is this a good movie. It is hard to say because for every good scene there is a juvenile scene obviously put in to satiate the masses. Good direction though, very good direction. That said, Crusades lost money when first released, if you only look at its Domestic boxoffice rentals but was the biggest grossing movie of its year.',\n",

And the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say: limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though.

              "  b\"With Mission Impossible like precision, Sean Connery, Lesley Anne Down, and Donald Sutherland pull off The First Great Train Robbery, years before Jesse James did it in the American West. <br /><br />Of course holding up a train with a dozen masked bandit confederates doesn't equal the near precision complexity that it took to steal gold bullion off a train by three men in stealth. Connery is the mastermind of the scheme and he plays Edward Pierce with the usual charm we've come to associate with Connery. <br /><br />It was interesting how Connery gets the idea for the heist in your typical Englishman's club with at least one of the responsible parties for the gold in that very room. The other club members know him as a retired industrialist who seems rather well fixed and comfortable. If they only knew the real source of his comfort.<br /><br />Lesley Anne Down may have given her career performance here as Connery's girl friend. Their scenes fairly crackle with witty repartee and sexual innuendo. Down is certainly not above using her sex to help in the robbery. In fact the first part of the plan which took about a year in preparation was to get duplicates of four keys that unlock the safe on the train where the bullion is transported. She compromises one of the key custodians in a Victorian bordello which is the film's humor highlight.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland is the safecracker friend of Connery's enlisted for the caper. He gets the dirtiest details of the caper. In fact the authorities get wind of some kind of plan in the works and Connery has to make some last minute adjustments to his plan. The adjustments call for Sutherland to get into the car in a coffin with a dead cat for odorous effect. What some won't do for money. Sutherland handles the whole thing quite well.<br /><br />Connery has the dangerous part of the caper which calls for him to go from front to back on a moving train. Those sequences according to the Films of Sean Connery were shot in Ireland which better represented the look of rural 1855 England. I was stunned to learn that Connery himself did the stunts. Sean admitted himself that it was the most dangerous business he ever undertook for any film. What some will do for the sake of art.<br /><br />The First Great Train Robbery is a stylish caper film set in Victorian Great Britain and the film really captures the look and manner of the period. One of Sean Connery's best films, definitely worth a look.\",\n",
              "  b\"From what little I've watched of Ferrara's work up till now - 6 films including the one under review - this emerges as easily the most substantial (I liked his BODY SNATCHERS [1993] but have always deemed it an unnecessary update).<br /><br />It's generally compelling and filled with typically intense performances - Christopher Walken and Annabella Sciorra from Ferrara's THE ADDICTION (1995), Chris Penn, Vincent Gallo and Benicio Del Toro (though some of the over-the-top histrionics, usually involving Penn's bad-tempered character, do raise the occasional unintended chuckle). The plot, adopting a flashback structure which leads up to the titular occasion, deals with the director's favorite themes - honor, faith, violence - and, as such draws parallels with the gangster films of Coppola, Scorsese and even Tarantino.<br /><br />On the strength of this, I rented two more Ferrara titles - FEAR CITY (1984) and KING OF NEW YORK (1990; again, with Walken) - to go along with BAD LIEUTENANT (1992; which I just recorded off late-night Italian TV, where it was presented in the original language); the latter two, in particular, are films that I've been meaning to check out for years (I just hope it'll be worth it).<br /><br />By the way, though I rented THE FUNERAL from my local DVD outlet as part of a 2-Disc Set with THE ADDICTION, I was actually the one to have brought it over to him from London!\",\n",
              "  b\"Super Dimensional Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? Ah, what a name and what a movie. This is what classic Japanese Animation is all about. Just the name itself conjures up nostalgic memories of yesterday, running home from fourth grade to catch the latest episode of Robotech, to attending my first Anime convention and realizing the true power of the unedited series as well as this incredible film which retells the story. The music, the characters, the animation and the story are the very things that attracted me to Japanese animation in the first place. And still, even after all of these years, SDFM:DYRL not only holds up, but is still a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />This is due, in no small part, to the creative talent and storytelling capabilities of Shoji Kawamori. Although his filmography may be small, it is an example of quality over quantity. Kawamori's Macross series made giant transforming robots, singing pop-idol young starlets, heroic floppy haired boys, and melodramatic drama popular to thousands of fans across the globe. Who in their right mind never dreamed of someday flying a Valkyrie, or meeting a girl as spunky and hot as Lynn Minmay or as gorgeous and smart as Misa Hayase? Or who never wished that their hair were as cool as Max's blue locks or Hikaru's tangled mop? And who never wished for the experiences and friendships shared by the Defense Force as they battled the onslaught of the Zentradi forces? Without Kawamori, none of these questions would have ever even been possible. To me, this is like trying to imagine a childhood without Star Wars.<br /><br />SDFM:DYRL is at it's core, a story of an alien invasion. The Zentradi, a race of aliens created for only war are hell-bent on tracking down a lost ship, the Macross, which is the key to the universal power of Protoculture. Protoculture is the universal matter from which all things were created and it gives life to those who have it. The Zentradi track down this lost ship, which has landed on Earth. The humans of Earth learn, to a somewhat limited degree, the power of the Macross, and are able to escape with a few hundred survivors to the outer reaches of space, thus setting in motion the constant game of cat and mouse between the Zentradi and the humans. Although this story is quite basic on the surface, what really set Macross apart from the other giant-invading-robot movies/series was the investment the audience had in the characters.<br /><br />The animation itself is quite beautiful, although it may seem somewhat primitive by today's digital standards. It is, however, a great example of how Japanese animation differs from its Western counterparts. While Western animation, especially concerning studios such as Disney and Warner Bros., put more energy into creating smooth animated movement, the Japanese directors and artists have always been more interested in creating insanely detailed drawings. Some Japanese directors have claimed that Japanese animation is actually more of a mix between the detailed still drawings of manga and the fluidity of traditional Western animation, thus it is an art form in and of itself being neither comic book nor cartoon. Macross is a perfect example of this ideology. Although the animation may not be extremely fluid, what we are given are vastly detailed cityscapes, landscapes and space frontiers, as well as mechanical and character designs to die for.<br /><br />And how can I possibly even mention the word Macross without at least a brief mention of the music? Kentaro Haneda, who created the original music, made sure that the score and songs were as captivating as the film itself, as well as making sure every note of every song fit perfectly with what was being shown on screen. After all, with music playing such an intricate roll in the entire Macross saga, the music really needed to be top notch \\xc2\\x96 and it was.<br /><br />SDFM:DYRL is a classic in every sense of the word. A movie that is just as good today as it was almost 20 years ago. Some films do not live up to the memories we have of them, and as we get older some films lose their power. SDFM:DYRL on the other hand, becomes a beacon of light to remind us of the reasons we fell in love with Japanese films in the first place.\",\n",
              "  b'I watched this movie to look at Neve Campbell.....possibly the reason the movie makers made it. She is beautiful and a fine actress. A lot of the dialog was interesting,seemed to be a lot of ad libbing. What the heck was Lori Singer doing in the movie? Neve\\'s character meets her in the park and says \"Hi Lori\" and they talk a few minutes about movies. Mike Tyson also makes an appearance as himself and seems to have some acting talent. The film starts and ends with Neve Campbell in a shower. The rest is a waste of eyes and ears. I usually agree with Roger Ebert,but he was one of the very few critics that liked the film. He gave it a top rating. Maybe he loves Neve more than me.',\n",
              "  b'\"Batalla en el cielo\" is one of those inert, enervating art movies that comes along from time to time and has highbrow critics reaching for the superlatives. By using amateur actors it masquerades as naturalistic, but it is in fact as artificial as a piece of modern conceptual art.<br /><br />**Major spoilers ahead** <br /><br />Set in present day Mexico City, what little story there is revolves around a chubby middle-aged chauffeur named Marcos (Marcos Hernandez), who together with his even chubbier wife, seems to have kidnapped a baby who has subsequently died. All this drama happens off camera, as does just about everything else that might be of interest, except for the sex. Indeed, Marcos has quite a lot of sex, both with his wife and (separately) with a much younger woman named Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), the daughter of his rich employer. Marcos, who may or may not be guilt-ridden about the infant\\'s death (it\\'s anybody\\'s guess, since all the actors have clearly been directed to refrain from anything resembling emotional expression), tells Ana about the kidnapping and she encourages him to turn himself in to the police. Later on he stabs Ana to death and then joins a religious pilgrimage, dying on his knees in church. As has been well documented, the sex in \"Batalla en el cielo\" is very explicit indeed. Director Carlos Reygadas seems to be garnering praise for the mere fact that he has filmed overweight and not very attractive people naked and having sex. But really, so what? It\\'s been interpreted as some kind of laudable corrective to the cosmetic eroticism that Hollywood and the porn industry peddles. It isn\\'t, of course, for the simple reason that the movie overall isn\\'t remotely good enough to mediate the intended visceral impact of lengthy depictions of actual sex. In the context of the story the extended and graphic nature of these scenes is simply as unwarranted as it would have been if the actors were beautiful and glamorous. Admittedly the sexual imagery does provide momentary glimpses of the raw and vulnerable humanity of these people, and had it featured in a more emotionally rounded and professionally told story it might have carried a much greater resonance. As it is, just about everything that happens feels meaningless and remote, because Reygadas evidently has no interest in supplying his audience with any interpretive hooks, and unsurprisingly none of the amateur actors is skilled enough to fully inhabit on screen the bodies that they have so boldly put on display.',\n",
              "  b'This movie is just bad beyond belief. The acting is horrid, while the cast is simply reciting lines with little feeling. I do wonder where they got these people. The actors just chop up the dialog like a salad. The television idea is just that, with no real sense of development in a hopeless, lifeless plot. The lack of a music track in 1935 is not uncommon, but some sort of musical score was really needed in a suspense movie of this type. I had wanted to see his movie for years. Now I can honestly say I am sorry did. As many a horror movie philosopher has said, somewhere in the middle of an endlessly dark night, \"There are some things that are best left alone.\" This movie, sadly, is one of them. May it rest in peace.',\n",

Art direction could have been much better, as could have been cinematography. The acting was good, and so was Eva van der Gucht's singing.\",\n",
              "  b'This is a movie called \" The Mean Season \" and stars one of the best action actors of today\\'s cinema. Kurt Russell is Malcolm Anderson a Miami reporter working for a Florida newspaper called the Journal. He is suppose to be an experienced hard hitting journalist who\\'s immediate future is to retire his position, get married and move to a small town and settle down. His girlfriend\\'s idea, not his. Unfortunately, a serial killer appears and calls him with the shocking details of a recent murder. Thereafter he is hooked into covering the macabre story for national coverage and that does not sit well with his girlfriend Christine (mariel Hemingway) who is stunning in her role. Richard Jordan is Alan Delour a mad killer out to prove he is not mad at all, but desires some half witted attention from the reading public. Andy Garcia in his debut appearance is Ray Martinez, a police detective. William Smith is Albert O\\'Shaughnessy, a veteran counselor and is surprisingly good in the small role. But it is Russell who despite his best with his character is less than convincing. The story line is clear cut and chasing Jordon proves elusive. For Russell fans, there is much to be desired and waiting for the finale is disappointing. Still, I like to see Kurt Russell and so the film is sadly relegated to his second string. ****',\n",
              "  b'Although not quite as good as it\\'s sequel, \"Emmanuelle: Joys of A Woman,\" this film made Dutch actress/model Sylvia Kristel an international star, and changed the way sex was presented in mainstream film forever after. Filmed in exotic Thailand, this is the engaging story of a beautiful young woman\\'s sexual awakening, (or sexual corruption, depending on how you look at it.) Emmanuelle is the 19 year old wife of a wealthy diplomat, a man older than her, and with much more worldly experience than his innocent young bride. Jean is proud to claim that Emmanuelle is not his possession, and that he would like nothing more than for her to be free to explore her own sexuality. However when Emmanuelle falls in love and runs off with a female friend, her husband doesn\\'t deal with it as well as he thought. Emmanuelle, played by the exquisite Sylvia Kristel, is surrounded by people eager to teach her all about eroticism and sensuality. There are the bored, jet set wives who spend their days lounging by the pool in tiny swimsuits and gigantic 70\\'s sunglasses. There is the young girl, Marie-Ange, forever sucking lolli-pops, who teaches Emmanuelle not to be ashamed of masturbation, (in a very hot scene,). There is the bitchy Arianne, forever trying to seduce the younger Emmanuelle. And finally there is the older man, Mario, who is the catalyst, the man who \"breaks\" Emmanuelle, through a series of sometimes disturbing sexual games, re-inventing her into the sexually liberated woman that we see in the numerous sequels. And for those only familiar with the sequels, this is an important one to see, as this is where Emmanuelle comes into being. It is quite fascinating to watch this character develop from a wide eyed innocent, into a free-thinking sexual being, a woman not afraid to enjoy what men have enjoyed since the dawn of time. The erotic scenes are tasteful, and never go beyond soft-core. \"Emmanuelle\" is an erotic film with a lot of class and style. There is a particular scene which has been cut from many new DVD releases; a violent rape scene in an opium den. The scene is important, as it is a pivotal scene in Emmanuelle\\'s \"education.\" It is the scene that breaks her, and makes her realize that sex is not something to be feared. In the scene directly following that rape, she is brought to a Thai boxing match, where her body is the prize for the winning fighter. This sexual encounter could have been a rape also, but because she is not afraid, there is no rape, just a consensual act that she derives great pleasure from. Classic 70\\'s theme, more controversial today than it was then. This is a must for fans of cult and erotic films. And if you enjoy this, seek out \"Emmanuelle 2;\" it\\'s even better!',\n",
              "  b\"Marco Tullio Giordana deserves praise for bringing this saga about two brothers in Italy that spans a few decades and paints a picture about the country. Mr. Giordana and the writers of this series made for television, Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, painted a rich canvas of modern Italy as events of the last forty years surface in this gripping tale of two brothers and the people whose lives they touched.<br /><br />It's impossible to summarize the events we see in the film. After all, it's running time and all the things that happen are too numerous to mention. Suffice it to say, the story never loses the viewer's interest as proved when we recently watched the two part DVD. We had no idea what we were getting into, but almost by magic, Mr. Giordana and his collaborators took us to a wonderful trip.<br /><br />Best of all are the great characterizations Mr. Giordana was able to get from the two leads: Luigi LoCoscio and Alessi Boni, who play Nicola and Matteo Carali. Some excellent ensemble playing was also achieved by the large cast in this series.<br /><br />The inspired cinematography by Foberto Forza does wonders to enhance all we see. The score include music by Bach, Mozart and even Piazzolla.

              "  b'ASTRO BOY is a full-length CGI animated American adaptation of the massively-popular Japanese manga (comic book) and television series fictional character of the same name ASTRO BOY, created by Ozamu Tezuka, who is considered as \"the God of Manga\". Its manga series was first published in 1952 and its television program first broadcast in Japan in 1963.<br /><br />Basically the storyline of Astro Boy is a sort of futuristic version of Pinocchio, but is extended by story lines of action, adventure, and pure sci-fi. Astro Boy is a robot boy, who initially has gone through an identity crisis, but later on, serves as more of a superhero who gets into various adventures and is consistently bent on promoting peace in his society wherein robots live side-by-side human beings.<br /><br />Arguably, Astro Boy is the quintessential children\\'s action hero because he is an ideal mix of pure innocence, a loving heart, and an explosive little dynamite when the going gets tough. Although he shoots lasers, and has weapon turrets from his butt, he is always doing his best to resolve things with a more friendlier approach, and always has that cute optimism that even the darkest of villains may possibly be persuaded do good things instead.<br /><br />This recent Astro Boy movie is indeed, in my opinion, a good way of reintroducing Astro Boy to a younger generation. Spectacular and fun-filled, the movie is never a waste of time. The eye candy aspect is high; it almost reaches the level of Pixar quality. The action is moderately impressive, on the other hand, it has the best \"I can fly\" sequence (I\\'m talking about that sequence when the main character discovers he can fly or do superhuman things and goes out in a self-indulging fun trip) and is superior in comparison to those in movies like Spider-man, Superman and Iron Man. It may be just animation but when Astro Boy is having fun in the sky, his joy radiates unto the audience.<br /><br />Although this is not all comedy from start to finish, the humor was enough to make the movie enjoyable. There are only a few punchlines placed here and there, but no matter how few they are, they pack a punch of solid laughter. I was really amused at the three robots that referred to themselves as the Robot Liberation Front. They were probably my favorite characters in this entire movie. From their quirkily hilarious character designs up to the overall portrayal of these robots, they easily got me tickled pink.<br /><br />While voice actors Freddie Highmore as Astro Boy and the rest of the voice cast such as Kristen Bell, Bill Nighy, Donald Sutherland, Nathan Lane, and Eugene Levy were all generically good, it was Nicholas Cage, voicing Dr. Tenma, Astro boy\\'s father, whose voice acting complemented excellently with the animation. It was as if it captured Cage in one of his best acting moments. It would not have been easy to bring the character of Tenma to a full-length movie version without altering it. In the original manga (Japanese comics) version and in the TV series, Tenma is portrayed as more brutal and has certainly a darker character, as he deliberately abandons and sells Astro boy, and in one other interpretation, he goes insane. The Tenma portrayed in this new movie version is a more positive version, as he is still bound by love for his creation, Astro Boy. Inevitably and obviously you expect this Tenma to do the morally upright thing.<br /><br />The storyline aspect was pretty solid. Simplistic to be family-friendly, yet it has some plot and characterization elements that appeal to adults as well. It ends up as a movie that is both young at heart yet mature in content. Enjoyable for kids, interesting for adults. The story does not treat its audiences like idiots, and manages to tell the story without applying unnecessary restraint that can hinder a writer\\'s creativity. In addition, the writers and the rest of the crew have an enormous pressure to make this project become perfect. That is because Astro Boy is like a national figure in Japan, as much as how Mickey Mouse is towards Americans. And in my opinion, the Americans did deliver a good script for him.<br /><br />Inevitably, the movie keeps itself faithful with the source material on Astro Boy\\'s origins but there are indeed many little alterations made in order to update this Astro Boy as being this generation\\'s version. Rife with enough heart, humor, and spectacular explosive action, this movie has a storyline that easily pleases its audience. It is indeed worth your time & your money if you are looking for a family-friendly movie this week.',\n",

I\\'ve watched many other thrillers over the years, most with larger budgets, and would place this one somewhere in the middle of the pack. Blackport gives a decent acting performance, though not of the caliber of other great \"thriller\" actresses such as Jodie Foster and Laura Linney, and yet the movie was quite compelling and intense. Sure, the story plot was simple, and some of the cast came across a bit stilted, but nevertheless it held my rapt attention for its entire length.

At times I was having more of a time picking out who I recognized from other films....the wanna-be pimp was the gas station attendant from Dusk Till Dawn, the drunk at the bar was the head of the jail from Bad Boys (Sean Penn flick, NOT the Martin Lawrence one with the STOLEN name), the bartender is a bit player in many films. This movie reminded me somewhat of Blind Date with Bruce Willis in that everything was going wrong on his night out too and he also ended up getting busted.',\n",
              "  b\"The plot of A Taxing Woman is interesting/enthralling, regardless of the production date or language of the film. Watching tax evasion cases unfold is surprisingly interesting, presented in a manner that shows the more human side of government organizations. (OK, if not the 'human side', at least you get to see what it's like on the inside.) From a cultural perspective, a 1980s Tokyo is also interesting, with shots of the cityscape, pachinko parlors, love hotels, etc.<br /><br />One last comment: There is nudity in this film, but It adds to the story of the film, justifying why some of the characters do what they do.\",\n",

If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? Well, he'll likely be better off if he disregards the VOICE OF THE WHISTLER.<br /><br />This William Castle directed entry has some great moments (the introduction and the depiction of Richard Dix's life through newsreel a la Citizen Kane), and some intriguing plotting in the final reels. Dix's performance is generally pretty good. But, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. Also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />This is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role.\",\n",

It's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a script, and a little money and walla you have a movie. Problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds. The video store shelves are filled with these so called films. These aren't even guilty pleasures, they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making trash cinema, but most of their films are b movie gold. However, some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some, like 'Nightmare Weekend,' didn't deserve any form of release at all. <br /><br />Pros: The cast members do the best they can with the lousy material. Some unintentional hilarity. Moves at a good pace (Should at 81 minutes).<br /><br />Cons: Awful writing, which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes. Poorly lit, especially the night scenes and the ending, which you can't make out at all. Doesn't make a lick of sense. Badly scored. Cheap and very dated effects. Total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody. This is supposed to be a horror film, but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I never expected this to be some forgotten gem, but I never imagined it would be this bad. I don't know if it's the worst film ever made, but it's a definite contender. Troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release. Don't make the same mistake I did and let your curiosity get the best of you.<br /><br />My rating: 1/5\",\n",

Maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera couldn't hold still because they were having a seizure or something. There is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie. There is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and doesn't stop until the credits roll. I also didn't like when all her friends were being shot (or not I don't know)and she goes in the van and puts band aids on. That was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie. How much gas can a person siphon to get a van going? It must be a whole lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie.

In fact, as an audio skit, this wouldn\\'t be out of place on a \"Firesign Theater\" album. But the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates \"Strange Case\" into the kind of jaw-dropping performance that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics. <br /><br />The Brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed \"tics\" of character and timing, and the creators use both to good effect here. Cleese\\'s portrayal of \"Holmes\" seems to owe much to the Arkin\\'s and Seller\\'s \"Inspector Clouseau\"; however Cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own. But the unexpected treat here is Arthur Lowe, who plays \"Watson\" as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film. I\\'d never heard of Lowe before this (his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I\\'m concerned.<br /><br />Some people might not care for \"Strange Case...\", especially if British whimsy isn\\'t their \"cuppa tea\". But I am extremely glad I got to see this before it vanished from sight.',\n",

Because with all of these so called scientist, experts working on how to kill them you would think the solution would be harder then taking a trip to your local Home Depot. This movie is so bad it was good. First thing I didn't get the time-line. The man who dastardly invented these mutant bugs seems to also have picked up the use of super warp speed traveling while working in the lab late at night. One minute he is in Virginia and the next minute he is in Pittsburgh. Same goes for the scientist couple. One minute they are living together the next scene they are separated and she is pregnant. And there was no indication that this was 2 months later..it was like the next day. They are married but for some reason they seem to keep their marriage a secret. Why I do not know. They work for two different agencies. Then we have her father thrown into the mix. Who just happens to be a farmer in the Midwest straight in the path of the Bugs. We see Lucy Loveless who plays the lead seemingly drive to Indiana with the redeemed dastardly scientist ( who BTW daughter was attacked by locust and is now in a coma)from the DC area in warp speed time to warn her father who I guess does not have a radio or TV but has have a super sleek cell phone that the bugs are coming straight for him! Meantime we have the real villain..no not the bugs, not the dastardly scientist but a angry 4 star General who seems a little too eager to gas people with the same poison used by Sadaam Hussian (as were are reminded) to kill the bugs. We see a scene with what looked like a herd of sheep but I think it is cattle since we later find out they were eaten by the locust. They are now carnivorous! This is getting better then that classic movie Frogs. Most of the movie is spent watching scenes of locust swarming down on crowds..causing mayhem at a airport but no one is killed by locust eating them. Except one person toward the end after we find out that they like to eat flesh.but no other reports of death by Locust. And he looks like he was attacked by Slugs. The rest of the movie is spent in a battle of the wills between the Maniacal General and the husband and wife scientist trying to find a way to kill the bugs without killing folks. We have the usual war room scenes too. OK OK time is up for the solution. Seems like the good old Bug Zapper was the solution. This they figure out while bugs get zapped while trying to get into a silo! Yes one giant bug zapper. One had to think that during a day in the backyard having a barbecue someone would of noticed what those things hanging up off a tree limb was there for. Considering every time any bug got near it meant certain death. Kind of like seeing this movie.\",\n",

I\\'m sure if I owned this DVD I\\'d always wish to skip by the poorer stuff.<br /><br />I really liked Donny Osmond, Elaine Page, Michael Ball and the various \"Cats\" songs and the song by Boy Zone.<br /><br />I was greatly irritated that they let Antonio Banderas sing the Phantom. He just does not have the voice for Phantom of the Opera. His Evita song was OK though.<br /><br />There were also a couple of songs by people that I did not recognize that had very bad unmusical voices.<br /><br />Sarah Brightman\\'s voice is good but her facial expressions looked a bit odd.<br /><br />DVD lovers will find the Dolby 5.1 track on the DVD sounds very flat. It feels more like Dolby 2.0 or even Dolby mono at times.<br /><br />So overall I\\'d give it 7/10. Since the best parts can be found on Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and on Cats (both of which I own already) I don\\'t feel compelled to buy this DVD. It is worth watching.

If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.<br /><br />This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen (I\\'m being nice - no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said). Not only was the storyline non-existent, but the action was crap too. I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win. And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his \"girls\" (an Imus comment would work in this case) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I couldn\\'t take it anymore. So, I only got to see half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I had ever walked out on. Afterwards, I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option.

The tone is like a humorous piece from The New Yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the \"Goings On About Town\" page of that magazine. The only thing odd is the casting. Made a few years later William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you wouldn\\'t have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in some shear and slinky outfits, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio.

I\\'ve never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.<br /><br />Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. So, her voice has very little inflection. I can\\'t believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to know somebody in the biz.<br /><br />Now I hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be \"this\" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.<br /><br />However, I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it.

These are all fine actors and they definitely showcased their acting abilities in this film. Peter Sarsgaard was presented a special acting award by the SIFF organization before this screening and looking back at some of his previous works, I think this was well-deserved. The story might leave some unanswered questions but that's the beauty of endings that leave you asking some questions.\",\n",

Especially when Cooper sat on the end of the bed during his conversation (which was by itself quite the fuss back than)with the girl. Overall the story also gives an interesting review of immigration and the nation's feelings about it. Hard work was certainly central to the movie's theme and of course the end is tragic as the guy doesn't get the girl.\",\n",

Another big advantage is that William Sachs\\' screenplay doesn\\'t waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches.

I have been greatly entertained by Miss Burrows in the past. I cannot say this was one of those times. Her acting was passable at most. She seemed to be high on marijuana, not drunk on homemade hooch. Mr. Mullan was melodramatic in his role of an ambitious footman, and to make him the \"romantic\" lead in the process was just hysterical! A serious bit of miscasting took place when they filled the role of Jean. He was too enthusiastic in areas where he should have been subdued and he was FAR TOO SUBDUED in areas where he should have shown fire and passion.

The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structure.

Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.<br /><br />There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston\\'s Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can\\'t do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.<br /><br />It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.<br /><br />The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson (Wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. This was poor character development. (Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). Wahlberg\\'s puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.<br /><br />Creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: Ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in The Green Mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon\\'s rocket: jumping apes looked as if they\\'d just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.<br /><br />In the original film, the various \"human\" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief (\"I never knew an ape I didn\\'t like.\" \"Human see, human do!\"). Here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.<br /><br />Nothing made me cringe more than the \"V-Ger from Star Trek\" moment near the end of the film. First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.<br /><br />Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the \\'60s and \\'70s, they generally didn\\'t have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I\\'m thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich\\xc3\\xa9 going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting, you\\'d have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it\\'s \"science fiction\" you don\\'t have to!<br /><br />Overall, Burton\\'s most disappointing film.',\n",

              "  b\"First the flaws: 1) The Headmaster is too broad a character. When he mounts the podium at the beginning of the school year, the stern and set expression on his face sets him off as a hidebound traditionalist and curmudgeon. He is the obvious villain here. No free spirit - like Mr. Keating - will last long under him. 2) We viewers are not prepared for Neil's suicide. Through most of the movie he comes across as a well-adjusted seventeen year old. He gets along well with the other boys. He is a natural leader. His penchant for acting appears to stem from serendipity, young male exuberance, and fun. Despite his martinet of a father he does not lie in bed long hours brooding, nor does he ever come across as depressed or manic. So when his father threatens to withdraw him from Welton after his successful debut in a Midsummer Night's Dream, he might argue with his father or turn sullen, but it strains credulity that he would go to directly to suicide. Now the qualities: 3) The production values are excellent. The location is idyllic - New Castle, Delaware is as elegant in reality as it looks in the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, at times lyrical. And the period details are right - like the boys smoking whenever grownups are out of the room - without being forced. 4) I particularly appreciated the acting of Neil's father. He has probably grown up under humble circumstances, and through enormous self-discipline, long hours and weekends of hard work, and seizing the rare opportunities that have come his way, has achieved modest financial success and comfort. At least once he tells Neil how much he has sacrificed for Neil's education at Welton. Neil's a good kid; he's getting straight A's. Like so many fathers in real life this father can't understand his adolescent son. His threat to withdraw Neil from Welton and send him to military school is so extreme it borders on the implausible. I fault the script, not the acting.\",\n",

After being conked on the noggin he revives to find he has spent the last nine years as someone he isn't and reverts to his former tricky self. His apple cart is upset when he discovers he is falling for the wife he picked up during the nine year blackout. A plan to bilk some of the locals over a phony oil deal doesn't appear so rosy once his thorny heart is pricked by love, which puts him in danger from a mean tempered associate intent on becoming rich. Fast paced and very funny film, well worth watching, especially Powell's zany character.\",\n",
              "  b'I\\'ve seen many of Guy Maddin\\'s films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke\\'s editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors\\' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin\\'s earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed more like harshness for harshness\\' sake.<br /><br />As I\\'m required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing \"Guy Maddin\" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.',\n",
              "  b'In-crappy-credible. That\\'s the word that comes to mind. How do movies like this get made? Was there no sane person on the set (never mind, they didn\\'t have a set) who had the guts to tell Claudio Fragasso \"sorry mate, this just ain\\'t gonna work, just give it up already before anyone gets hurt\"? Wow. That\\'s all I can say. I truly cannot summarize how awful this movie is in words. But I\\'ll try, anyway. I have to get this film out of my system before I go insane.<br /><br />Take some rednecks and ex-porn stars, throw them into some anonymous town in the middle of nowhere, slap a huge \"NILBOG\" sign on a pole, hire lots of dwarfs and some sh!tty costumes, and get the most over-the-top, annoying, washed-up Z-movie actress you can find to play the main antagonist, add a delusional kid who is almost as convincing as the thespian from \"Pod People\", and at least twice as irritating, and you have a movie. That\\'s the Claudio Fragasso way! <br /><br />So we have a kid actor with whom we\\'re supposed to sympathize, but he\\'s so bad I just wanted to hit him most of the time and tell him not to be such an overreacting little prick. Seriously, Joshua looks like someone is repeatedly kicking him in the groin whenever he tries to emote.<br /><br />Unbelievably, Joshua isn\\'t the worst actor in the film - even though everyone in this movie either screams or mumbles his or her casual lines , and even though Joshua\\'s mum looks like a crack addict psychopath during most of her scenes, the real Dung Beetle award for incompetent acting has to go to Deborah Reed. She plays Creedence Leonore Gielgud in a way that makes it hard not to think that the nice men in white coats were waiting for Deborah after major shooting of the film had finished. This woman has the scariest eyes I\\'ve ever seen, they\\'re constantly moving up and down, bulging in and out of their sockets so fast even Rodney Dangerfield would be scared. Her eyes are enough to almost distract you from her horrendous overacting, but only almost. Hearing her deliver her \"little flower\" speech makes you pine for the subtlety and depth of Vin Diesel. But enough about her.<br /><br />Can it get any worse? Actually it can, because suddenly a myriad of the aforementioned dwarfs - sorry, I meant goblins - appear. Think of an army of walking, oinking potatoes with bargain bin Halloween masks - those are the goblins. Sound scary yet? I thought so.<br /><br />Kill me now. I thought the film couldn\\'t get any dumber, but it did - suddenly Joshua realizes that \"NILBOG\" is actually \"GOBLIN\" spelled BACKWARDS!!! Yes, I\\'m stunned too. This truly is the most brilliant plot twist this side of M. Night Shyallaman. And so cleverly set up, too! I can assure you I did NOT see this coming, no siree. Gee whizz, what a shocker! All sarcasm aside, this is probably the part of the film where I completely lost it. The sheer look of shock on Joshua\\'s face upon his revelation combined with the \"scary\" music (which was probably stolen from some Japanese TV show from the eighties, by the way) - this is unintentional comedy at its finest. And by \"finest\", I mean \"most painful\".<br /><br />So, when all is said and done, what can we make of this movie? It\\'s low budget, so badly acted you\\'ll want to gouge your eyes out, unintentionally hilarious, blatantly homoerotic (Elliott having trouble choosing between his \"boys\" and his girlfriend, Elliott\\'s \"boys\" sleeping half-naked next to each other) and it gave me the impression that Claudio Fragasso has a fetish for the colour green. In conclusion this film has very deservedly earned itself a position on the Bottom 100, and I\\'m still blown away by the fact that there are movies this irredeemably awful out there. My review has barely scratched on the surface of how awful this film is - it\\'s worse than \"Red Zone Cuba\", worse than \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\", worse than \"Time of the Apes\"... and I wouldn\\'t hesitate to say that it\\'s *this* close to being as bad as \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" (interestingly enough, both films feature a hilarious scene in which the main characters inexplicably burst out in a chorus of \"Row your boat\"). My Bottom 100 marathon couldn\\'t have ended on a higher note of badness and I\\'m happy to say that I survived this ordeal (Watching \"Bloodrayne\", \"Captain America\" and this in a row) without any extensive brain damage... or did I? Anyway, to any devoted fan of bad movies, this is truly appetizing... and provocative. To quote Arnold, one of Elliot\\'s \"boys\": \"OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!\"',\n",

However, it's really just a movie for all the Beavis and Butthead fans out there, for whom plenty of sex and a bit of gunplay makes a film.<br /><br />The utter trashiness of this movie is found in the whole 666 gag. Whenever the protagonists purchase something at a store, the bill totals $6.66. That basically sums up this movie's ambition to be daring and rebellious, but exposes how pathetic these attempts are.<br /><br />Everyone who has branded this movie as dark and daring probably just read the tagline.<br /><br />Maybe that's what makes this movie so 'daring.' I suppose that, in a way, making a pathetically bad film is daring, especially when you put your name on it.<br /><br />Simply put, watching this movie is a painful experience. Hopefully it will claim it's rightful place on the bottom 100 before long. However, maybe that's too good for it.\",\n",
              "  b\"The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.\",\n",
              "  b'Movies like this that tread heavily into the surreal are fascinating to me. The moon (positive), the hole (negative or inverse of the moon), the man suddenly arising from the still mud (creation). I think that we can consider the movie as \"real\" or plausible if we consider that the characters arise from the writer\\'s consciousness. \"I\\'m going to kill them now (babysitter and her porn-star mother)\" Lorenzo says as he arises from bed, then over to his computer where he starts writing. Why does the dog kill the little girl? Does the dog symbolize lust (note Lucia keeps saying, \"I\\'m dying!\" as she has sex with Lorenzo)? This is all in his head, I think, or in the computer, and finally in the manuscript displayed at the end.',\n",

It was boring and the characters were flat and not interesting as they were annoying.<br /><br />I'm glad I watched it and I don't hate it but it's just no classic in my mind.

I\\'ve heard the 10 Tigers of Canton mentioned in passing in kung fu films about Wong Fei-Hung. Fei-Hung was not one of the 10 Tigers, he was known as \"the Tiger after 10\". However Wong Fei-Hung\\'s father Wong Kei-Ying was on of these 10 Tigers. Being a fan of Iron Monkey which featured Wong Kei-Ying as a main character I was looking to find similar movies featuring Wong Kei-Ying as a central character. I\\'ve also seen movies featuring another of the 10 Tigers, Beggar Su, as a minor character. I was quite intrigued to learn more about the 10 Tigers through this film, and to come to an understanding of the aura of mystique and legend that surrounds them.<br /><br />As a tool for gaining insight into the back-story, lives, and importance of these 10 Tigers this Shaw Brothers movie fails miserably. Wong Kei-Ying is a very minor character in this film. Rarely seen on-screen, he and fellow Tiger Wong Chin Ho are simply referred to in passing as \"The Wong Masters\". Beggar Su has a more prominent role in the film, but he does not look, dress, nor act the part of a beggar. Instead we\\'re treated to \"Acrobat Su\". While novel and fresh to use actor Philip Kowk\\'s talent as an acrobat in Five Deadly Venoms, the portrayal of Beggar Su as an acrobat as opposed to a filthy rag-clad beggar left a sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />This film fails to provide background information on each of the 10 Tigers and hence doesn\\'t deliver on explaining who each Tiger is and what made each one such a standout in the world of martial arts.<br /><br />While the costumes, sets, and martial arts action are all phenomenal and top-notch for a 1979 kung fu movie, The lack of character development really hurts this film as it could have been so much more, missing out on making THE one-and-only classic masterpiece about the 10 Tigers of Canton.<br /><br />I can only hope that someday soon a contemporary Hong Kong director will come out with a film that does justice to the 10 Tigers of Canton, because this Shaw Brothers movie fails miserably at doing such.',\n",

She\\'s living in a cheap motel room in a city somewhere, shooting up on wolfsbane and keeping a chart of how long it takes for self-inflicted wounds to heal -- hoping against hope that she might never become a werewolf. Occasionally she is visited by the ghost of her dead sister, who haunts and taunts her throughout the movie (you can\\'t have a Ginger Snaps movie without a Ginger, right?). One night she manages to overdose on wolfsbane, and she gets picked up and taken to an outreach centre where she is kept caged like an animal and deprived of the drug ... but what they don\\'t know is that she\\'s being hunted by another deadly werewolf, who has a strong desire to mate with her.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps : Unleashed is even darker than the original, both in the metaphorical and in the literal sense of the word. It\\'s also a lot weirder ... so if, like me, you\\'re a big fan of weird, odds are you\\'ll probably lap this up like a bloodthirsty wolf. There are plenty of great twists and turns in the plot, and the casting is really amazing. Eric Johnson and the young Tatiana Maslany both deliver superb performances in the two main supporting roles. In most respects, many agree that this sequel is in fact better than the first movie ... but they\\'re both so great, I don\\'t even feel the need to compare them.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about the fact that this wasn\\'t written by the same team as the first movie (in fact screenwriter Megan Martin seems to have no other credits to her name), but it is actually an interesting twist on the original, written by someone who clearly understood what Ginger Snaps was all about. There are two main formulaic werewolf plots ... the first involves our hero changing into a werewolf, which will eventually lead either to finding a cure or to their death (as in the first movie), and the second is about a group of characters being stalked by a werewolf, and for an added twist perhaps the werewolf is one of them. This film incorporates both of these formulas into an excellent, engaging horror story.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps is probably the first great werewolf movie to have a worthy sequel, and if that wasn\\'t enough they had to go and do it again a third time. If you haven\\'t seen this whole trilogy yet, you definitely should.',\n",
              "  b\"Manic wasn't a good film but it wasn't a horrible film either. There are many problems with this movie. If there's a few problems with a movie I can usually overlook them but Manic had far too many to just dismiss them. They bothered me the entire movie, especially since they were used to manipulate the audience and advance the plot.<br /><br />Why would a psychiatric ward be co-ed, especially when some of the teenagers are seventeen and some are thirteen? And Joseph Gordon Levitt's character had access to the women's rooms without any problem? That seems kind of ridiculous. If he's a sociopath what's to stop him or anyone else from raping the girls? I also noticed that there were adults in the yard with the teenagers. I don't think that would be allowed. In all likelihood the minors would have absolutely no access to anyone of the opposite sex or anyone over the age of 18 who was also a patient. <br /><br />This movie was self-indulgent tripe. It's too bad because I like Joseph-Levitt as an actor but all the characters were completely one-dimensional. Anarchy guy, Wigger guy, Goth girl. It was completely ignorant of teenagers and mental illness. What the hell did this have to do with being manic or mania or bipolar disorder? Joseph-Levitt was a sociopath. It was just more ultra-cool, hand-held, uber-indie tripe. Indie films used to be good before all this self-indulgent crap started coming out like Garden State.<br /><br />Manic kind of comes across as a corporate public relations bulletin for teens. This is what we think you are. It couldn't have been any more wrong.\",\n",
              "  b\"I read this Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen. Let me tell you, it's not a terrific play, it is easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. The acting was really lacking, the scenery-honest to God-looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality is lousy...there is this mind-numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks...and I also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is non-existant. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which would be OK but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more. In any case I think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which I don't really reccomend, then don't aim your hopes to high. The play, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.\",\n",
              "  b'\"Cavite\" proves that if the story is good enough, technical excellence is unimportant. Filmed on video with a crew of two, and no budget whatsoever, Cavite is a gripping, roller coaster of a ride. Called to the Philippines, a completely Americanized, young Filipino-American discovers that his mother and sister have been kidnapped. A cellphone planted in his backpack rings and he learns they are held by terrorists and he must follow every direction he is given or they will be killed. Guided by the terrorist\\'s voice on a cellphone, what follows is a tense voyage through the underbelly of Cavite, a city in the Philippines. Although this is at its soul a thriller, by focusing on stark images of third-world poverty, the film cleverly illustrates why terrorist acts have appeal for many. Like all classic thrillers the stakes get higher and higher and the tension grows as the story moves on to its inevitable climax. Although some critics have indicated that they thought the lead actor was lacking in ability I found exactly the opposite -- he is the perfect \"everyman,\" trapped in a situation not of his making. This is great storytelling. I saw this movie twice and recommend it highly.',\n",
              "  b'This film is not without merits - but it certainly is no classic. It\\'s aged badly, the characterisation is poor, and there are at least a dozen things about it that really grate, e.g.; the fact that the whole film is an excuse to use special effects; the fact that everyone blindly accepts the existence of ghosts and attributes any strange happenings to them without considering any other explanation; the cheesy horror clich\\xc3\\xa9s; the annoyingly sickly suburban family; the odd moral of the tale (treat those corpses with respect or else!); the American-dream-gone-wrong theme which doesn\\'t quite work (given the fact that this is a 10 on the daft scale); and, last but not least, the fact that one of the paranormal investigators is scared half to death by the crawling meat scene; and yet ten minutes ago, he was happily documenting dozens of levitating objects flying around a bedroom.<br /><br />That said, the special effects are quite good for the time, and the acting does it\\'s best with such a daft story. At this point, you may be thinking; \"this guy just doesn\\'t like the genre\". Not true; but in my opinion, effective, truly scary horror is created by the maxim \"less is more\" - not the more is more approach that Spielberg has employed successfully in other films, and less well here. A disappointment; go watch Ring instead for truly creepy television antics.<br /><br />One last thing; it\\'s appalling this got a PG in the US. One particularly disgusting scene involving peeling flesh is clearly unsuitable for kids, and I can imagine this giving young children nightmares, as hokey as it is. I suggest your kids should be at least twelve before you watch this with them.',\n",

I give it 4 because i love hammer films, if i didn't i'd be giving it a 2.<br /><br />If i was any of the actors in the film i'd be rather ashamed but then again it could be just for the money. If your a person who's seen it or is thinking of seeing it first read the book>scare your pants reading it>then watch the film>get board and see that the only thing close from the book is just the bloody title. go on i dare you it'll be a lot better.\",\n",

              "  b\"This film had a couple things going for it; it is obvious that some very talented people had a hand in creating this film, and the concept for the story had potential, but these were vastly overshadowed by the fact that it was uninteresting, lacked any kind of storyline, and was too real to simply be a girl's imagination. It lacks the imaginative quality of Alice In Wonderland, and substitutes it for random implausible scenarios. The story gives no background for the girl, no idea of who was fighting the war, or why, or if the people she met were real, and mutated by her imagination, or if she manufactured them completely. If she WAS trapped in this place, why did she never try to escape? The basic instinct in a human is to flee from or fear the unknown, of which she did neither. This movie did not even reach a conclusion, leaving you to wonder why you just wasted an hour and a half of your life. And what was with the naked little kids running around? Seriously!\",\n",

After I read the book I found out that there was a movie about this book and - because I really wanted to see those forms, the surface of Solaris and to compare them to those in my imagination - I watched it. But I the movie heavily disappointed me.<br /><br />Only about 10% of this movie represent the book. The rest is absolutely different. Different characters, different names and different storyline.

              "  b'Alejandro Jodorowsky is doubtlessly one of the most unique directors in the history of motion pictures. I guess I am not alone by stating that his brilliantly bizarre midnight movie milestone \"El Topo\" of 1970, the surrealist masterpiece \"The Holy Mountain\" (1973) and the stunning \"Santa Sangre\" (1989) all rank among my favorite films, and that there is hardly another living filmmaker I respect as deeply as Jodorowsky. Made eleven years before his impressive feature length debut \"Fando y Lis\" (1968), Jodorowsky\\'s first film \"La Cravate\" (aka. \"Les t\\xc3\\xaates interverties\"/\"The Severed Heads\") of 1957 is a delightful surrealist silent short, which was long considered a lost film. While this film may not be as essential as \"El Topo\" and \"The Holy Mountain\" it is definitely a highly memorable film for lovers of surreal avant-garde cinema and Jodorowsky fans in particular. Jodorowsky made this film when he was in Paris, where he had joined the troupe of celebrated pantomime Marcel Marceau in 1954, and become a part of the surrealist movement.<br /><br />I don\\'t want to get into detail about the plot, so I\\'ll just say this much - the film is a surreal mixture of Fantasy and bizarre love-story which revolves around the possibility of exchanging one\\'s head... The film is set in (a painted) Paris, the characters are entirely bizarre, and some of them very lovable. Jodorowsky himself plays the leading character, and, in his comical costume with a huge collar, has barely any resemblance to the full-bearded gunslinger he would play in \"El Topo\". The film also stars Jodorowsky\\'s future wife Denise Brossot and American actor Saul Gilbert. Gilbert died shortly thereafter, and his wife, who was from Germany, took the only copy home with her after his death. The film then disappeared in an attic for almost half a century, until it was rediscovered in 2006. How lucky for us! Compared to Jodorowsky\\'s later films \"La Cravate\" - the original title refers to the tie worn by Jodorowsky\\'s character - is very harmless and innocent, which also makes it a nice contrast to his other films. While his feature length debut \"Fando Y Lis\" of 1968 is in black and white, this 1957 debut short is very colorful, by the way. All things considered, this is a worthy debut of a cinematic genius, a great short film, and an absolute must for my fellow Jodorowsky-fans.',\n",
              "  b'\\'\\'Ranma \\xc2\\xbd\" is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, that is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained together during many years. <br /><br />Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo\\'s: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.<br /><br />Ranma and Akane fight all the time,specially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda,many new characters and situations starts to happen.

              "  b'You might initially be reluctant to give \\'The Glass House\\' a try if you\\'ve been turned off by many recent \"thrillers\" as they often have been disappointingly by the book. This is your eerie psychotic chase thriller similar to movies like \\'Pacific Heights\\' and \\'Unlawful Entry.\\' And, though it does play by the rules (unforutnately), there is something about it that makes it more entertaining than the recent dismal fare (not that Pacific Heights wasn\\'t highly entertaining).<br /><br />Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby Baker, a kid going through the terrible teens. When she and her brother\\'s parents die in a car accident, they move in with ultra-modern family friends, Terry and Erin Glass. You know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the Glass couple, but you can never be too sure exactly what at first (that\\'s the purpose of a thriller, to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you\\'re--hopefully--pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed). But, Ruby Baker is a smart kid who\\'s ever-present skepticism about the intentions of her new surrogate parents, and starts trying to figure out what\\'s wrong. Unfortunately, this movie does terribly follow the book when it comes to the main character being disbelieved by other well-meaning characters (social workers, lawyers, teachers, etc.) who consequently pay with their lives for their doubts and unwillingness to really investigate, and in turn, making things worse for poor Ruby. It also follows the book when it comes to the deranged finale and the he\\'s-not-really dead ending.<br /><br />But, there is something that makes this better than most of its kind. On the one hand, you\\'re never sure whether you can always trust Ruby because even she, too, arrogant most of the time, seems like trouble. It\\'s hard to sympathize for a character like that at first. And, not only does Stellan Skarsg\\xc3\\xa5rd make an appropriate villain as Terry Glass, his wife (played by Diane Lane) is not entirely an innocent creature herself as most women are often written to be in the role of the creep\\'s wife/girlfriend/mother, etc. A good mix of characters and a creepy setting, combined with a decent finale, make it just the perfect mix of suspenseful elements. And one that I would recommend seeing.',\n",

I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I\\'m sorry to say, Ms. Ellen\\'s chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy.

They seem like characters out of a<br /><br />Fellini film, only stranger, if that makes any sense. Old Edie is<br /><br />almost fully bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes<br /><br />growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She<br /><br />prances around the house, always wearing a baboushka-like<br /><br />headdress around her head, completely covering her hair. We<br /><br />never see her hair throughout the film, nor do we ever get a hint<br /><br />that she still has much. At age fifty eight, though, she is still<br /><br />beautiful and full of life.<br /><br />In Grey Gardens, we get the sense that both of these women\\'s<br /><br />lives have become much less than what they once were. Little<br /><br />Edie is probably the sadder of the two. While her mother, in her<br /><br />earlier years, got married, made a family, lived luxuriously and<br /><br />even made some recordings (the scene where, at 77, she sings<br /><br />along with a recording of \"Tea for Two\" she made decades ago is<br /><br />one of the films best scenes), Edie left her promicing career as a<br /><br />model to take care of her ailing mother. At 58, she still longed to<br /><br />find her prince charming. If anything Little Edie is still a little girl,<br /><br />full of dreams of glamour and fame, and of domestic and romantic<br /><br />bliss, that have yet to be fulfilled.<br /><br />Highlights of the film include the opening moments, where Little<br /><br />Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the \"tea for two\" sequence,<br /><br />the birthday party, the climactic argument, the grocery deliver<br /><br />scene, and the scene in the attic.

It\\'s also my first for the Monogram entries, of which this one is the second. In this one, a young woman\\'s stepfather is murdered in a closed room. She enlists Charlie in the case through communicating with his \"No. 3 Son\" Tommy (Benson Fong) while both stay at a hotel. Also along for the ride, for only the second time, is cab driver Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland)...The noticeable changes from Fox to Monogram, besides more comic relief with both Fong and Moreland, is some more time for the music score to go along with some more action sequences near the end before we hear Charlie\\'s assessment of the case. Also, the plotting isn\\'t too serious and Chan\\'s wisecracks to his son seem almost mean-spirited, like Abbott & Costello like, though one can take them with a grain of salt. And while Mantan\\'s antics, especially his looks of fright, would probably not do in these politically correct times, he still can be entertainingly funny with what he does here and I don\\'t think it reflects badly on his race at all since to me he\\'s just a funny looking clown who\\'s quite endearing, whatever the race. So on that note, I quite recommend Charlie Chan in the The Chinese Cat. P.S. Mr. Moreland was a native of Monroe in my now home state of Louisiana. And Sam Flint, who played Thomas P.

The movie's possession theme is solidly played out with some tight direction. Sholder gives this movie some well-done moments of shock and dark humor. The opening sequence on the bus is a memorable thrill ride. The film boasts some bloody FX. Charles Bernstein's theme music is missed, but Bing Crosby's song 'Did You Ever See A Dream' makes for a nice touch. Many say that this movie has homosexual themes and granted star Mark Patton does spend much of the movie semi-naked, but the theme is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />Robert Englund makes a welcomed return as Freddy, while the rest of the cast does decent performances.<br /><br />All around, a good sequel that hasn't really gotten critical justice.<br /><br />Followed by the superior Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987).<br /><br />*** out of ****\",\n",

This was meant to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC Network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage due to it\\'s sexual references. This film however, is very amusing. Elvira is the modern-day Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one-liners. This film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal \"Elvira\\'s Haunted Hills\" which was meant to be a take-off of the old Roger Corman movies but falls flat on it\\'s face.

              "  b'Probably the biggest letdown of my sci-fi viewing life. Even worse than the 3rd \"Alien\" movie. So many bad points that I can\\'t remember them all. I\\'ll touch on the lowlights.<br /><br />First, as the unidentified object approached earth, everyone seemed dumb on the reason for the change in direction. Duh uh, like wouldn\\'t a spacecraft immediately come to mind as a possibility?? Then the excitement and anticipation of a visible ship was taken away by clouds and fog and a vague vessel.<br /><br />As stated elsewhere, the initial contact in the park was ended with Klatu getting shot for an offered handshake (no mysterious equipment popping open). And several times in the movie, there were vehicles, equipment and/or people more evenly spaced out (in large areas) than a marching band.<br /><br />Rather than go over a scene by scene critique, the following complaints come to mind. 1)bad writing; all actors had trite and often repetitive lines. 2)The Secretary of State was scary, illogical, and didn\\'t seem to be in much contact with the bosses(the President and VP). 3)Poor or no acting by the \"Stars\" and the kid. 4) choppy flow, frequently too slow or unclear. Weak continuity, scenes seemed to be just stuck together. 5) Gort was pathetic. Like the recent \"Hulks\", unconvincing CG and too big to realistically show it in contact with humans. (should have gotten Shaq for the part).... 6) No actor to actor chemistry ever formed. 7) The final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the \"standing still\" time and the alien departure. What message did he leave us with? <br /><br />Since I\\'m a poor typist and can\\'t immediately recall all of my issues with the film, I\\'ll end my comments by saying that I have no problem with changing a remake so that it is more up to date and offers some different twists to add interest. However, this film completely missed the mark of maintaining the strengths that the original script had, namely convincing acting with consistent story and character build-up leading to a dramatic final scene with a clear message to all of the world.<br /><br />They could and should have done far far better.',\n",

This is pure Hitchcock with an 80\\'s dash of lurid perversion, an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists, huge helpings of style, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot. De Palma\\'s love of complex camera-work and luscious, blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma\\'s wife at the time) and Michael Caine make every scene special.

              "  b'This was the first of the series that I have seen, having nothing else to do this afternoon and having seen most everything else in theatres that I wanted to see. SPOILERS HEREIN<br /><br />The first segment, entitled \"L.T.R,\" chronicles the relationship of two young twenty something boys (emphatically \"boys\") who meet and \"fall in love.\" They invite a videographer to tape a documentary about the weeks that follow until the relationship is shown to take a turn that neither boy expects. Hopefully, what transpires in the weeks that pass teaches the boys that there is a marked difference between love and lust. This one is by far and away the funniest segment.<br /><br />\"O Beautiful,\" the second segment, was by far and away the most touching. It begins with a boy having just been sexually violated and beaten up by other boys in a dark cornfield. We\\'re spared seeing the attack as the scene begins immediately thereafter. The victim is approached by a young man who arrives on the scene and does what he can to comfort the victim first by wiping the blood from the boy\\'s face, giving him his jeans, and later his letterman\\'s jacket. The \"rescuer\" at one point starts to sing \"America the Beautiful\" at one point while they are engaged in debate over the victim\\'s homosexuality and the brutality of the attack. The rescuer advises the victim in a none too tactful way that he was essentially a victim because his actions displeased God. Although the boy who rescues the victim at first tells him that he left the scene before the attack began, he later admits that he stood and watched while the attackers stripped the boy naked from the waist down and allegedly violates him with a stick. Obviously, it\\'s a stretch of suspended belief that the guy is not bleeding to death from the damage that such an act would cause his internal organs. The segment ends with the rescuer, who basically admits that he was wrong not to protect the victim from the onset and gives him his pick-up truck which the injured boy then drives away in leaving his \"rescuer\" in the middle of the cornfield at night. An understandable, but unsatisfying ending. The acting could have been much better, I would have liked to have seen tears instead of attempts to generate them, but still the most moving of all four segments.<br /><br />\"Bumping Heads\" tells the story of a 35 year old man, Craig, and his twenty something companion, Gary, who are in the emergency room of a hospital as a result of a fight Craig was involved in in a local gay bar. Craig made the unfortunate mistake of trying to save Gary from an lecherous stranger in the back room of the bar, and gets his noggin cracked for his efforts. The physician treating Craig assumes that the two men are lovers because of the way they treat one another, i.e., fawning, finishing one another\\'s sentences, etc. Turns out, Gary has a long term lover who lives on the west coast (the story taking place on the east) and had never mentioned it to Craig. Craig makes one last effort out of many to entice Gary into a romantic relationship that fails miserably because he thinks he has convinced both himself and Gary that the two of them would be great together. This segment, to me at least, was the least interesting and almost pointless.<br /><br />Finally, \"This Car Up,\" which is told quite imaginably (you have to see it for yourself), about two men who seem diametrically opposed to one another in every possible way. Pete is a suit in a downtown office building, Adrian is a multiply-pierced bicycle messenger who have a chance encounter when Pete takes a smoke break outside his office building. They\\'re each smitten by the other and, in the end, find romance in form of a lingering kiss in the building\\'s elevator. The kind of kiss that only two straight actors (I\\'m willing to bet) can share; no tongues. This is the only story that ends with the proverbial \"happy\" attached.',\n",
              "  b'Coming immediately on the heels of Match Point (2005), a fine if somewhat self-repetitive piece of \"serious Woody,\" Scoop gives new hope to Allen\\'s small but die-hard band of followers (among whom I number myself) that the master has once again found his form. A string of disappointing efforts, culminating in the dreary Melinda and Melinda (2004) and the embarrassing Anything Else (2003) raised serious doubts that another first rate Woody comedy, with or without his own participation as an actor, was in the cards. Happily, the cards turn out to be a Tarot deck that serves as Scoop\\'s clever Maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of Woody Allen comedy.<br /><br />Even more encouraging, Woody\\'s self-casting - sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years - is here an inspired bit of self-parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters. In Scoop, Allen astutely assigns himself the role of Sid Waterman, an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage-patter who, much like Woody himself, has brought his act to London, where audiences - if not more receptive - are at least more polite. Like Chaplin\\'s Calvero in Limelight (1952), Sid Waterman affords Allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative. Moreover, because they seem in character, Allen\\'s ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time. <br /><br />Waterman\\'s character also functions neatly in the plot. His fake magic body-dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim. Introduced on a River Styx ferryboat-to-Hades, Strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can\\'t rest in eternity without communicating one last \"scoop\" about the identity of the notorious \"Tarot killer.\" Unfortunately, his initial return from the dead leads him to Waterman\\'s magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate, Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician\\'s climactic trick. Sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant Waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father. As demonstrated in Lost in Translation, Johansson has a talent for comedy, and the querulous by-play between her and Allen is very amusing - and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance.<br /><br />Scoop\\'s serial killer plot, involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), is the no doubt predictable result of Allen\\'s lengthy sabbatical exposure to London\\'s ubiquitous Jack the Ripper landmarks and lore. Yet other facets of Scoop (as of Match Point) also derive from Woody\\'s late life encounter with English culture. Its class structure, manners, idiom, dress, architecture, and, yes, peculiar driving habits give Woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire. When, for instance, Sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with Peter Lyman at a ritzy private club, Waterman observes \"from his point of view we\\'re scum.\" A good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved British social manners encountering Waterman\\'s insistent Borscht-belt Jewish plebeianism. And, then, of course, there is Waterman\\'s hilarious exit in a Smart Car he can\\'t remember to drive on the left side of the road.<br /><br />As usual, Allen\\'s humor in Scoop includes heavy doses of in-jokes, taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as, increasingly, references to his own filmography. In addition to the pervasive Jack the Ripper references, for instance, the film\\'s soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of Grieg\\'s \"The Hall of the Mountain King,\" compulsively whistled by Hans Beckert in M, the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre. The post-funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed Joe Strombel clearly mimics the opening of Broadway Danny Rose (1984). References to Deconstructing Harry (1997) include the use of Death as a character (along with his peculiar voice and costume), the use of Mandelbaum as a character name, and the mention of Adair University (Harry\\'s \"alma mater\" and where Sondra is now a student). Moreover, the systematic use of Greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to Hades recalls the use of Greek gods and a Chorus in Mighty Aphrodite (1995).<br /><br />As to quotable gags, Allen\\'s scripts rely less on one-liners than they did earlier in his career, but Scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones. To a question about his religion, Waterman answers: \"I was born in the Hebrew persuasion, but later I converted to narcissism.\" And Sondra snaps off this put-down of Waterman\\'s wannabe crime-detecting: \"If we put our heads together you\\'ll hear a hollow noise.\" All in all, Scoop is by far Woody Allen\\'s most satisfying comedy in a decade.',\n",
              "  b\"You'd have to be a fan of farces to like this. It has some novel ideas, such as illegally obtaining a fresh cadaver that has to be transported from the city morgue to the school, while rigor mortis is beginning to set in. Alan Arkin has a secondary, not a starring, role. He brings more to the part than the writer gave him. Steve Guttenberg is surprisingly good as the son of a doctor who can't get into an American medical school, or even a first or second grade foreign one. Curtis Armstrong, in particular, is terrific in his medical student role. Over all, however, this is strictly a B movie. Julie Haggerty is terrible as the glamorous student with whom the school director (Arkin) is enamored. There is nothing alluring about her looks, and her approach to comedy acting is out of sync with the rest of the cast's.\",\n",

Her performance was most enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come.<br /><br />AND, this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.',\n",
              "  b'WARNING: My comments should be regarded as - a sad old sod\\'s musings on a movie remembered fondly from his youth! I\\'m not going to dissect the movie scene by scene. I won\\'t compare Forsyth\\'s earlier works with his best known or \"finest\" moments. I\\'m not even going to discuss any particular aspect of the film! Not the setting, the story, the dialogue, not even the individual performances! I\\'m simply going to say that I remember watching this movie (with my family) on TV back in the early eighties and laughing so hard it actually hurt! I have no idea if it has aged well or not because I haven\\'t seen it in over 20 years but I will say this in it\\'s favour/defence, \"That Sinking Feeling\" gave Glasgow a voice and a character that\\'s rarely been heard before nor since! Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not a Glaswegian so I have no personal axe to grind in that respect, I just feel that the human face of Glasgow (or Scotland for that matter) hasn\\'t been depicted quite so sympathetically as in this movie. It seems to me that, when contemporary filmmakers try to present an \"honest\" depiction of the Glaswegian he tends to go for the \"gritty realism\" of the drunk or the druggie or the wife beating hard-man! That Sinking Feeling took a different tack and demonstrated the dry Scottish humour we all recognise (even more-so, we natives of Scotland) and perhaps that\\'s why we seem to remember it so fondly. Anyway, if you can find a copy, watch it! Just don\\'t expect any cool CG effects or Seinfeldesque banter, just good clean working class urban banality and the comedic observations you\\'d expect from a good clean working class director feeling his way!<br /><br />Incidentally, sometime back in 1992/3 I met the redheaded actor (shamefully I can\\'t recall his name right now) from \"That Sinking Feeling\" working in Stirling castle, conducting tours and the like! Not only does he star in one of my favourite productions, he is also an all round, really nice guy!<br /><br />Bonus!',\n",

And he's not just comic relief - he actually acts and is the voice of logic for Goulet, who believes he may be hopelessly in love. The songs are thoughtful, wistful, even sad in a heroic way.\",\n",
              "  b\"Near the closing stages of Baby Mama, one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess'; I really couldn't say it any better than that. And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again, the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time. A lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour. Consisting mainly of very routine, clich\\xc3\\xa9 jokes based around an odd couple (rich and poor) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world, the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic.<br /><br />As a story on finding love, it's not that bad, but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent, characterisation is notably weak, resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles. As characters themselves, both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces, but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness; so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times, the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles; we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting, but rather their dynamic. Unfortunately however, although this dynamic works best, or at least better than the individual personas, as mentioned above, it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula.<br /><br />Kate (Tina Fey) is a successful business woman who has hired working class, dumb-blonde Angie (Amy Poehler) to be her unlikely surrogate, and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl (Dax Shepard), both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences. Yes, it's the typical odd-couple premise, and one that we have already seen in this year's What Happens in Vegas, yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters. Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air. In fact, the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man. Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama, most of those moments were because of this man, and the remainder usually fell to Shepard.<br /><br />It's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera, and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough. Yet, for a film about babies, multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping, this isn't necessarily a good thing. Baby Mama is grade-A, hammy, plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar. So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature, but I simply didn't care for the world they inhabited. The dialogue, along with sets, costumes, and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy; these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any way\\xc2\\x85 so why should I care? At the end of the day however, a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests, and the frequency of its laughs; Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments. Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair. I'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings, but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored. In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable, but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch, Baby Mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\",\n",

Why do they leave out the main character's descent into madness when he is left on the island by himself and sees the beastmen degenerate into animals? Where's the social criticism, by the way? That having been said, this film isn't entertaining on *any* level. It's slowly paced, nothing ever really happens, inexplicably Dr. Moreau attempts to turn Michael York into an animal, and ultimately the film goes no where. On the small plus side?

Liam Neeson contributed his usual fine job, as did a nicely creepy David Baldwin, and a nice mob boss performance by Andreas Katsulas (better known as the One Armed Man from the Harrison Ford movie of \"The Fugitive\"). Good little wussy role by Ben Stiller; nice supporting job by Helen Hunt. Patrick Swayze does a good dependable job in this movie, but is outshone by the finely understated performances of the men playing his relatives from backwoods Kentucky. Great use of Chicago locations, though the \"L\" trains running past my house don\\'t appear to have the conveniently flat roofs to jump on. (Alright, a minor quibble). All in all, quite worth watching.',\n",

Matty gives it a 7 while the average voter gives it a 4.9.<br /><br />It isn't a bad film, but shallow. Definitely below average. So the average around 4.9 is maybe more appropriate than a higher number; certainly 7 is 'way beyond the range.<br /><br />What can you expect of a film that has Michael Moore in it. That alone knocks it down at least two full points.<br /><br />You get what you pay for, so don't pay any money for this one.

              "  b\"This movie makes some odd choices. On the one hand it's a good looking and also clearly professionally made movie with lots of talent involved but it just makes some wrong choices in its storytelling.<br /><br />The movie obviously starts of as a dramatic 'based on true' events movie but soon as the movie starts to progresses it starts taking some obvious 'Hollywood' turns, with its emotions and action and the story becomes more unlikely and clich\\xc3\\xa9d. Of course nothing wrong with this, since it definitely makes the movie an entertaining and bit of adventurous one. But in this case the approach doesn't really work out, since it also obviously is a movie that wants to be taken seriously and has a clear message in it. You know, the kind of message to 'save the rain forest'. It also uses lots of technology vs. nature elements. I'll admit that this movie is a better attempt than all Steven Seagal attempts combined but no, that doesn't mean that this movie is a perfect or truly successful attempt on its own. The movie seems to lack the proper emotions to see this as a completely effective one, though the right intentions are definitely there. I mean for instance, the characters within this movie see each other again for the first time in 10 years but yet they seem hardly affected by it all.<br /><br />The natives scenes also aren't always among the best or most interesting one's out of the movie. Sure the nature environments are beautiful looking but it slows the movie a bit down in the middle, which also is in big contrast with the serious and dramatic first part of the movie and the action filled final part. The entire movie doesn't always feel like one whole. The parts of it are all too disjointed.<br /><br />It nevertheless it is a rather good- and also entertaining enough movie to watch, despite its obvious flaws and bad choices in the storytelling.

I have all of his films in my collection. I closed my eyes and picked one, just like that, at random. \"The Age Of Innocence\" This is what happens with great artists, you can always re visit them and you\\'ll come out of the experience with something new, something valuable. Transported by the sublime voice of Joanne Woodward I took the trip again to discover that everything in this extraordinary universe that Martin Scorsese, based on Edith Wharton work, is not what it appears. Conventions out of the window, breaking every imaginable rule. Just as the characters get off their trucks, swimming against the tide of the times. Scorsese breaks cinematic rules with such artistry that we\\'re allow to inspect, re live and enjoy a story as old as the world from a completely new perspective. Is as if Luchino Visconti had suddenly woken up with a new contemporary sight to look back with. Daniel Day Lewis is so marvelous that the pain of his predicament becomes more than visual, becomes visceral. For Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder this was the zenith of their careers. They are sensational. The casting, as usual in a Scorsese film, is superb even in the smallest roles. Glimpses of Sian Phillips, Alexis Smith and Geraldine Chaplin add to the pleasures, making this overwhelming banquet of a film one of the most rewarding film experiences I\\'ve ever had.',\n",

Sure enough, he is careful not to say anything that would offend anyone, and as a result all you get is a bland movie where everything is sort of cancelled out by everything else. Frontier women are strong and self-reliant, except that sometimes they need help from menfolk. Indian warriors are brave and good, except that some of them are evil and brutal. Violence is tragic, except sometimes it's the only way. The white settlers really want to be nice to the good Indians, but somehow they all get killed in the big gun battle. So of course it's nobody's fault they're all gone. Nothing happens here that didn't happen in LAST OF THE MOHICANS, except with no romance at all and very dull characters mucking about in dirt and snow and looking miserable.<br /><br />What would have made this movie work would have been a strong love story between Cate Blanchett and -- well, not Tommy Lee Jones, but maybe some powerful Mexican landowner or something. Like they get down to Mexico and Cate's daughter has been stolen, so she has to see the incredibly rich and aristocratic Mexican governor, who is an older man and a widower. And he helps her get her daughter back, riding by her side like a guardian and protector, only he and Cate fall madly in love so at the end she stays on in Mexico living in his hacienda and being treated like a queen. And instead of Cate in the dirt and snow all the time you would see her enjoying new clothes and new surroundings and trying on jewelry and things like that, with her very distinguished husband sort of smiling at her in the background. And her bratty daughter could just marry some nice young officer.<br /><br />And Tommy Lee Jones could get eaten by a pack of Gila monsters.\",\n",

Lloyd\\'s pursuit of the serial killer puts his job on the line and pushes him over the edge. Tightly written and directed by James B.

              "  b'Okay... it seems like so far, only the Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint. Beware, this writeup is *LONG*.<br /><br />For those not in the knowing (mostly the non-Belgians) : Tom Barman, director of this film, is the frontman of dEUS, one of the better known rock bands of the late 90\\'s here in Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale. Then, egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart, with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUS-monicker. The way it always happens in such cases, the post-breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album \"The Ideal Crash\" in 1999, presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting. They didn\\'t quite make it. However, egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies.<br /><br />More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake, and this film does not make the exception. And Barman clearly went for *art* on this one, another very big mistake. For one thing, he\\'s a musician, not a movie director. For another, dEUS at it\\'s best made fun and provoking music, but never anything close to what I would consider *art*. It shows.<br /><br />So, what\\'s this movie about? Basically, it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people, doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp, as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting. The characters are shallow, the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn\\'t have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh (not quite loud). Mood? The film just doesn\\'t seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well, (*MINOR SPOILER*)the idea of the \"wind-man\", inspiring the name of the film, is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very, and has been done a thousand times before (anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino\\'s worst appearances on film to date)(*END MINOR SPOILER*). And well, its *artistic*, so don\\'t expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. In other words, except for the few smiles, it bored me out of my shorts.<br /><br />So what remains? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST\\'s have shown lately : first, it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD. Second, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs, which simply doesn\\'t work. In the end, it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. And sadly, it\\'s Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention, though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I\\'m concerned. All in all, it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is okay as well, though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.<br /><br />The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of \"guess-the-location\" game. I would hardly consider this as a quality though.<br /><br />All in all, another chance lost for Flemmish film. I keep on noticing that lately, the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country. This is mostly because at least, they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional (the brothers Daerden come to mind). Maybe the Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too.',\n",

He claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke. But the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage.<br /><br />Steven Seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel, the lead role this time round goes to Bill Golberg (Steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end.) But there's a reason he hasn't done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners. Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.<br /><br />This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it. It does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along. **\",\n",

Paul Etheredge-Ouzts definitely knows his horror just as well as TENSION\\'S creators, but the more positive take he puts on the \\'gay\\' angle will make it more accessible to gay and straight audiences alike.<br /><br />And wait till you get a load of HELLBENT\\'S inventive and suspenseful \"trick\" ending.

We see him grow increasingly concerned as one guy after another, all bigger and stronger than him, get up to fight and return in a state of dazed semi-consciousness. <br /><br />A lot of times when I watch these early comedies from Chaplin, I get the feeling that he is often trying to create at least a mildly engaging story throughout which he can throw in a lot of kicking and punching scenes, but in this movie it's the kicking and punching the drives the plot, giving the film an unusually honest feel. <br /><br />High-energy physical slap-stick is what Chaplin did best at that time, and smacking around a huge mountain of a man while he dances carelessly around as only he can is certainly a treat to watch. And the climactic battle between Charlie and the meaty Bob Uppercut (or Young Hippo, depending on which cannibalized version you may see) is well-acted and fun. <br /><br />Mack Sennett like his comedies to be fast paced and high energy, without too much time wasted on things like characterization or even story. But in The Champion, Chaplin proves that we can have well-developed characters, an easily discernible story, and still have enough action and solid slap-stick to keep the shorter attention spanned audience members entertained. This is definitely one of the best short comedies that Chaplin had made up to that point.\",\n",
              "  b\"Somehow, this movie manages to be invigorating, bittersweet, and heartwarming at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the tale to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird's.<br /><br />Paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything being said. The military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. She teaches him manners, etc., while traveling across the country to find Paulie's owner. The movie continues with several twists of fate, until Paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement, and found by a Russian custodian, who is touched by the bird's story. the plot is in keeping with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift, and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding. A beautiful mixture of flute, digital base, and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy. The sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more. And, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable. (Unlike in star wars, where Yoda resembles a Muppet) This film is one of my favorite movies, with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently. Overall, I give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug.\",\n",
              "  b\"If you don't mind having your emotions toyed with, then you won't mind this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you'll be very disappointed.<br /><br />Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment: <br /><br />* While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children's view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery.<br /><br />* The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues.<br /><br />* In England, driving is on the left. The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when it could have easily parked immediately behind, or even on the side; as the huge truck did.<br /><br />* The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime, but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall.<br /><br />* Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting.<br /><br />* It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk.<br /><br />* It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators \\xc2\\x96even coaxing her daughter to do the same-- while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park.<br /><br />* The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow/dimwitted --justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother\\xc2\\x97 but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate.<br /><br />There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado's disappointment. 'Five Days' is a very weak British crime story.\",\n",
              "  b'KINGDOM COME / ** (out of four)<br /><br />By Blake French:<br /><br />\\t\"Kingdom Come\" opens with a not so tragic death in the midst of a dysfunctional family. The husband of Raynelle Slocumb (Whoopi Goldberg) suddenly kicks the bucket while eating breakfast at the kitchen table. He leaves his wife not with wonderful memories but with only two adjectives to describe him: mean and surly. This incident triggers a family reunion to celebrate the life of their relative. Most of the family members hate each other and are not particularly happy with their awkward ruination.<br /><br />The family members all appear to be spoof material from some stale TV soap opera. Actually, \"Kingdom Come\" is best described as a made for TV Soap Opera spoof. The script gives the variety of eccentric characters unique little quirks that replace development but establish their lifestyles. It\\'s funny how the movie begins and ends with the Whoopi Goldberg character. She is the only person in the family with whom we connect. She realizes that her relatives are resentful fools, and provides us with a kind of wisdom that really benefits the movie. <br /><br />\\tThe film is based on the play by David Dean Bottrell and Jessie Jones, who also wrote the jumbled, unorganized screenplay. Director Doug McHenry does not provide the story with much focus or interest. There\\'s about four subplots of equal importance, but we never actually care about any of the characters. Some of the characters are truly irritating, like a clueless Reverend, played by Cedric the Entertainer, who was so witty and edgy in Spike Lee\\'s \"The Original Kings of Comedy.\" Here he is simply a medium for the film to spew ungraceful humor; his speech mannerism and character development are painfully unfunny. No matter, the movie continuously stretches his stupidity, especially during a closing scene of obligatory fart jokes during a funeral reception. This scene may be somewhat funny, but its context, it is way out of place. <br /><br />\\tA top-notch cast delivers a variety of situation characters, including Raynelle\\'s alcoholic son (LL Cool J in a performance worthy of the Razzie Award), and his scolding wife (Vivica A. Fox). Her daughter (Jada Pinkett Smith) is married to an adulterer (Anthony Anderson). Another daughter is Marguerite (Loretta Devine), who tries hard to control her slacker son (Darius McCrary). There is also a rich loudmouth Cousin (Toni Braxton) and I already mentioned the gaseous Rev. Hooker (Cedric the Entertainer).<br /><br />\\t\"Kingdom Come\" is a movie obviously driven by moral beliefs and powerful conviction, and while its intentions are noble and understood, it never manages to get its point across clearly. The film just cannot successfully display its message in context to the story on screen. It tires to be a warm-hearted, family-orientated comedy like \"Soul Food,\" but does not hold the same standards for itself. What we end up with is a preachy but whimsical comedy that can\\'t make up its mind whether it wants us to laugh or join the chorus.',\n",
              "  b'OK, I don\\'t really think that Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines, because they kick ass. They just... conflict with each other.<br /><br />For Example: Near the end of the movie, it shows Ricky and Julian telling \"Patrick Lewis\" to put the dog down and walk away. Then at the end, it shows Ricky and Julian saying that they\\'ve been in jail for 2 years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian yelling at \"Patrick Lewis\". But in the TV series, they\\'ve supposedly only been in jail for 18 months.<br /><br />Also, they give us the impression that the movie\\'s story line and the TV series\\' story line are connected (because of the yelling scene between the guys). But some actors portray totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays \"Patrick Lewis\" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination, and then he plays Sam Losco in the series.<br /><br />Also (again... I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash. The thing is, they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway, other than the yelling scene.<br /><br />Sorry to keep on blabbing.',\n",
              "  b'The worst movie I have ever seen. There is no excuse for a low budget flick to be this awful. The comedy only serves to make a bad movie even worse. I want my money back. Do not waste your money or your time renting this movie.',\n",
              "  b\"Despite being gruesome and gory (and not for the faint hearted) this movie is a political piece of art and a beautiful representation of love. Give or take slight exaggeration, it portrays a clear example of the media's influences of mindless western masses to an immoral act that the majority of human instinct should be able to over power. I do believe killing is a natural animal instinct that as an evolutionary species, most humans should be able to distinguish as wrong. Yet when these 'natural born killers' create these anomalies of the human being, through media their faults can be praised and cheered, as the decreasing presence of morals, values and individuality of western society become history. But maybe all is not lost in western society. It is uplifting to see a couple truly devoted to each other. However, as this film appears slightly exaggerated in some respects, maybe by removing the rose tinted glasses, it would end in divorce.\",\n",
              "  b\"Truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening. A world vastly overpopulated, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer, and all our natural resources spent. In this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder, opposite the film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance.<br /><br />One of the images that will always stay with me from this film, is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which Thorne (Heston) has to hop through them every time he uses them.<br /><br />The movie's use of music is note worthy too, although it contains no score in the usual sense, The opening theme is good, and the subsequent snatches of music we here in Simonson's apartment, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric.\",\n",
              "  b'Therefore, I can honestly say, this was TERRIBLE. Firstly, every other positive comment HAS to be made by the people involved with the production. 8.5 rating? Really? Secondly, I love \"fake-umentaries\", but this was just bad. The acting was terrible... below B-grade. The \"great camera work\" was... well, up there with the acting. I know they weren\\'t going for \"slick\", but it was just bad. The production value was actually quite good, which just adds to the disappointing end result. I can never tire of the \"faux-cumentary\" genre, but it\\'s only been done right a few times. I\\'ll give the filmmakers the credit of coming up with a cool concept, actually getting it off the ground and distributed, but they failed at making anything remotely watchable. Better luck next time.',\n",
              "  b\"Once in a while a student film comes along that has a well written story, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful acting. Unfortunately Matthew Saliba's Pandora's Paradox is not one of these films. I happened to catch this short film at a New York film festival and I was far from entertained. Clocking in at about twenty minutes this film was a long watch and I found myself looking at the clock several times. This to me seems like the easy way to make a film nowadays, throw a bunch of random images on the screen, add some cheesy colored lighting, and toss in some annoying sound and voila end of the semester film project. What happened to constructing a well written screenplay? fully fleshed out characters? or even creating something original. The story has something to do with a boy, some doctors, a weird old guy with a phallic object on his underwear and a giant toe which somehow all leads to the main character and his withdrawal from life. The acting seemed like it was way better than your typical student film but it was hard to tell when the parts we're reduced to annoying laughter and screaming. Basically this film did nothing but annoy me and I can't really even think of a reason to recommend it. If you enjoy these kind of student films then this might be up your alley but Unless your looking for a Pretentious David Lynch knockoff stay far away from this film.\",\n",
              "  b'\"Donkey Punch\" is another movie in the sub-SUB-genre I have personally categorized and labeled the \"trouble on a yacht\" genre (other such films include \"Dead Calm\", \"Open Water 2\", and \"Visitors\" or anything that predominantly takes place in, on, or around a f!cking yacht...) and it certainly isn\\'t anything remotely compelling. The concept of the Donkey Punch - a sex act involving aggressive contact, applied to the back of a chick\\'s neck whilst performing anal copulation - was interesting, but that was really IT for the \"thrill\" aspect after that particular scene... We start off with the standard group of pea-brained party-girls vacationing in Spain, who meet up with some guys with a boat. There, it feels like an hour of pointless prattle, then a hot scene of group sex, Donkey Punch resulting in an accidental neck-snap, followed up by the whole \"lets ditch the body and get out of here\" routine... Strange how I\\'ve heard such positive things about this UK flick, because I actually found it enormously dull and drawn out. Not a whole lot of violence either - the best scene is an expected flair-gun blast that\\'s pretty funny, but otherwise there\\'s not much on that end... If only \"Donkey Punch\" had SOMEWHERE to go, plot-wise, after the first 30 minutes or at least tacked on a bit more T&A and a lost LESS of that hair lipped-meth-head and overly forced \"alpha-woman\" BS, it might have been able to hold my interest a little better. It\\'s just a weak and pointless flick, overall...',\n",
              "  b'I find that it is a good animation movie. This a comedy and drama animation. The music was very good, and the drawings are well drawn, especially when they are made with the hand. It is a film which makes reflect on the good to be company. The whole, it does not have there a scene of violence like the majority of the American and Japanese animation. The main character is a trouble maker but he has a good heart.People will cry after seeing this animation. I recommend to all to look at, even to the children, although it is sad and too heavy for them, because it is an example to be followed for all, children and adults.',\n",
              "  b'It\\'s not funny. It\\'s not stylish. Nor is it suspenseful, exciting, thrilling or chilling in any way. It\\'s not intelligent enough to even be viewed as some warped social commentary and it\\'s not ambitious enough to do anything other than present gratuitous T&A and gore in the dullest manner imaginable. Hell, it\\'s not even entertaining. What it really is an exercise in being completely and utterly pointless aside from presenting violent scenarios and nude women with in third world countries with unlikely silicone enhanced bodies. Oh yeah, the plot involves a trio of students (two Americans and a foreigner) vacationing in Eastern Europe who eventually stumble upon a pay-to-slay type business that specializes in making your sickest dreams come true (i.e. customers pay a high price to get to slaughter a real live person). And I am using the world \"eventually\" because it takes around an hour for this movie to get to the real horror content. First we have to sit through an excruciating hour dedicated to the juvenile frat boy antics of characters who stay wasted on booze and drugs and pay hookers for sex. A whole hour of this crap.<br /><br />Our \"heroes\" are stupid, irritating, immature, one-dimensional, unlikable and by the time their lives are in danger, you could care less what happens to them. I know I didn\\'t. I was actually rooting for the generic, anonymous bad guys to tell you the truth. To make matters worse, this film has a tacked on ending that tries to let the sole survivor enact his vengeance. These scenes are absolutely ludicrous and riddled with coincidence that certain characters just happen to be at a certain place at the right time. Hey, there\\'s three of them now crossing the street right in front of me just as I\\'m trying to escape the town! Well what do you know? How bout I run \\'em all over! There\\'s another one who happens to be on the same train as me as I\\'m leaving the country! Well I\\'ll follow him into the bathroom... etc. etc. etc. The end.<br /><br />This movie is absolute garbage from start to finish. It\\'s nothing new or interesting. There is some gore, but it\\'s pretty much what\\'s expected and nothing too shocking for anyone who has already sat through films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Dawn of the Dead. Director Eli Roth may be 35 years old, but his brain functions at the level of someone 20 years his junior based on his juvenile screenplay and uninspired direction. Roth himself later claimed to make this film \"to show Americans\\' ignorance of the world around them\" and in the process only shows his own ignorance when it comes to film-making. Absolutelty the pits!',\n",
              "  b'I thought this film would be about an aspiring white hip hop artist or rapper who was going through some reverse racism while he was trying to get his career started, and boy was I wrong. This has nothing to do with hip hop. The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, and their are several sequences that have irritating static over the dialogue.<br /><br />I saw this film during its world premiere in Philly and I am ashamed it had anything to do with Philadelphia. I understand it was meant not to be a masterpiece, but instead like great pics like the Naked Gun and Airplane, but this had no flow to it the scenes made no sense. Like the ridiculously bad and unfunny scene where KO is tied up and two chicks come in and act crazy and take his pants off. Oh and the scene where two goons tie up KO and leave him in his office, why would you tie him up just to leave him in the same place he was at? Myself and my date could not get to sleep over how bad this film was. If anyone even remotely found this funny please tell me why because I will be in disbelief. This is the first and probably last film I will ever submit anything to on this site because it is that bad. the only person in this film that still should have some dignity left is the chef guy who claimed all black people are addicted to ranch dressing, that scene was not bad.<br /><br />Again, this has nothing to do with hip hop, it has one scene where a white guy raps and that is all, so where the title came from I do not no. this is what happens when a white director tries to make a film about black culture, do yourself a favor and stay away.',\n",
              "  b'I loved this movie as there were so many moments people in their late 20 somethings and 30 somethings could relate to.

              "  b'I have a feeling that many of us have entertained the whimsical notion, as we dragged ourselves to work in the morning, that it might be nice to have hot coffee fed intravenously into our systems. Well, in the misleadingly titled Boris Karloff vehicle \"The Man With Nine Lives\" (1940), we get to see that such a procedure might be as pleasant as imagined. In this picture, experimental patients of one Dr. Mason, who\\'s looking to cure cancer victims via cryogenics, are brought out of deep freeze in just that manner! Dr. Mason and his nurse fianc\\xc3\\xa9e soon discover the body of cryogenics pioneer Dr. Leon Kravaal, 100 feet underground in a Canadian ice cave, where he\\'d been laying frozen--a corpsicle--for a full decade. Dr. Kravaal (played by Karloff, of course, in still another of his overly ardent scientist roles) is remarkably brought back to life, and begins his scientific pursuits anew. Anyway, this film is a fairly restrained affair, impeccably acted by its small cast, economically written, nicely photographed, and captured here on a pristine-looking DVD. The goateed Kravaal, likable at first, grows increasingly deranged as the film progresses, but still manages to hold the audience\\'s sympathies; a brilliant scientist using unethical methods to achieve great ends. Despite the far-fetched central conceit of the possibility of freezing a man indefinitely and bringing him back to life, the movie is fairly believable; a testament to its intelligent script and fine players. But wait...did I say \"far-fetched\"? I have a feeling that Walt Disney, Ted Williams and thousands of frozen sperm cells the world over might disagree with that sentiment!',\n",
              "  b\"What starts out as a predictable film documenting the Miss World Canada pageant, quickly evolves into a dramatic and entertaining film that keeps you riveted to the screen. The final evening where the winner is crowned is one of the most beautiful and compelling moments I've scene in documentary film. Beautifully styled shots and a sparse yet rich sound design leaves you feeling emotionally drained by the end. The way the film cuts from the backstage frenzy to the silence, beauty and calm serenity of the girls on the stage is absolutely breathtaking. Attempting to do a film on a beauty pageant could very easily have been nothing more than fluff, but this is a film that doesn't try to uncover anything more than the raw emotions that happen during the pageant.\",\n",
              "  b\"Unfortunately rather overlooked as this film came out the same year as Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's 'Todo Sobre mi Madre' which went on to reach fame and glory. However, if you liked Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's excellent drama you will also like 'Solas'. The two films have certain similarities inasmuch that also in 'Solas' the accent is very much on strong characterisation, profound human feelings, though perhaps a little less intense here than in Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's film. <br /><br />Ana Fern\\xc3\\xa1ndez is magnificent, playing just right the rather confused, unlucky thirty-five year old young woman a bit given to alcohol, not overplaying her part; Mar\\xc3\\xada Galiana as her mother shows even at her age that she has come from good theatre, as no less does Carlos \\xc3\\x81lvarez-Novoa as the lonely neighbour. Benito Zembrano - as Almod\\xc3\\xb3var - , not only directs his film but is also responsible for the script, which is truly magnificent, especially taking into account certain Andalucian styles of speech. The Andalucian accent may at times cause a bit of a problem if you know Spanish a fair amount and watch this film without any subtitles. Try it, anyway: it is well worth the effort. <br /><br />An excellent piece of drama which certainly deserves more recognition than it has got. Curiously both films end with a remarkably similar dedication at the end: 'A mi madre; a todas las madres' - To my mother; To all mothers.\",\n",
              "  b'I have a severe problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I\\'ll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour.<br /><br />If you don\\'t wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn\\'t) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I\\'ll summarize: Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV, \"Two And A Half Men\" and \"The King Of Queens\" as the television executives. Now then, on with the review.<br /><br />These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn\\'t Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel\\'s enemy? Why doesn\\'t Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, cause he\\'s the dumb one and he\\'s comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility.<br /><br />The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be \"comedy\" requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development).<br /><br />This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn\\'t right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I\\'ve provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven\\'t heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /><br />I have watched very little of \"Friends\" in my life, but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. If you\\'ve read this far, thank you, and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned.',\n",
              "  b'While it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not exactly the truth. They took a lot of liberties in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30\\'s. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. in the gang at various times, and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout, and in fact got drawn back into crime. Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie\\'s wound was much more severe and never healed right. It was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up, and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe. I know, I\\'m being nit picky, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this \"TRUE\" story, the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives, rather than being a cohesive flowing story.<br /><br />I\\'d recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.',\n",
              "  b\"At the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts. It all looks very promising from the get go. With some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. The main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. Normally a person in his situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and God. And they provide the answer for his problem. It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it always is helpful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. While the message is good,it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie. The mystery that is presented to us never gets solved. In stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Don't get fooled because of Malcolm Mcdowell. The once brilliant actor is adequate,but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all. He really must be desperate for money. Otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.\",\n",

Without revealing any plot details--on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place. It was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard. Later on, in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven. This was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldn't be an option. These continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had. Also, I found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver. Even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too thickly for this viewer.\",\n",

I cannot imagine what Warhol was trying to accomplish, but viewing \"Empire\" must be a similar experience to sitting through \"The She Creature\". I made the mistake of starting to watch rather late one night, and found that my eyelids were drooping so badly that I had to stop the tape halfway through and continue the next day.

If you haven\\'t seen the movie, but have plans to do so (although I wouldn\\'t recommend that as you can see by my voting), I\\'d tell you not to read this beforehand.<br /><br />This movie is in the vain of similar torture movies (or \"gorno\" as they are called). While the American business man is supposed to be a everyday man we (or let\\'s say a \"western\" audience) can relate to, but still stay ambiguous enough, that never fully gets \"exploited\". Instead it\\'s more exploitation and in a bad way. Robbing a man of his \"senses\" and making it as painful as possible. But watching this is even more painful, especially because it is as predictable as it can get. While Saw (at least the first one) had an intelligent twist to the whole thing, this movie tries to disguise the whole torture thing with a social commentary, that just doesn\\'t work ...<br /><br />What I didn\\'t know, but read here on IMDb, is the fact, that this was based on a novel.

I did enjoy this film more then I enjoyed the unrelated precursor, \"When Boys Fly\", but neither of these films really got me going.<br /><br />Technically I\\'d consider the film on par with any other shoot from the hip documentary, so I have no real complaints in that department, but where I take issue is with the handling of the subject matter. I wanted to see more of evil people doing evil things. I didn\\'t get that. I wanted to see all the terrible conspiracies at work on how big business is taking advantage of the little guy, but it didn\\'t give that to me.<br /><br />In a way I broke my cardinal rule of making up my mind over a trailer.

BRIGHAM YOUNG (The \"Frontiersman\" was added for the European release), telling the story the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration brought members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)out to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after mobs murdered their prophet/leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America was about to enter World War II. It was a daring move on Fox chief, Darryl F. Zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the Mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen. Now Fox, working with James D\\'Arc, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this film to the DVD format in an outstading edition. Mr. D\\'Arc, who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film, has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a DVD. He seperates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why this films was so much appreciated by Church Leaders even though embellishments to the truth run throughout the film. One of the fun bits of information deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film he married a Latter-saint woman and was eventually converted to the LDS faith. There is much to be learned from D\\'Arc\\'s knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the DVD! There are over 100 pictures from the Fox & BYU Archives included on the disc, plus newsreel footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in Salt Lake City.

              "  b\"Kansas City Confidential is an excellent film noir on the cheap. It stars John Slightly Scarlet Payne playing a revenge-minded ex-con trying to even the score. (He's framed while driving a truck full of posies - probably the most unlikely guy to be framed for a bank job.) Like his part in 99 River Street, director Phil Karlson has Payne playing it both tough, street smart and at the same time good hearted. Yet there's no doubt that he could turn into a killer at any moment. The heist and eventual double crosses are good and very clever for this type of crime picture. I was also surprised (in a good way) that the movie showed some of the police as corrupt - by showing a false arrest and eventual beating. Not to mention a very bad cop behind it all. This movie proves once again that b-noirs were just as good as the big budget ones with Mitchim and Lancaster. And how about the bad guys? Lee Van Cleef AND Jack Elam. Nice.<br /><br />The film's title is misleading, though. Only a very small part of the film takes place in Kansas City. Almost all of it is in Mexico.\",\n",

But when the plane crashes en route, he and the other survivors (a photographer and his model, a Vietnam veteran and his wife, and a scientist's daughter) must attempt to reach civilisation on foot, without losing too many body parts on the way.<br /><br />Although the Italian cannibal craze had pretty much run its course by the mid 80s, a handful of directors tried in vain to scrape a little more meat off an already well-picked carcass, and delivered several offerings that did little to reignite interest in the genre.<br /><br />Ruggero Deodato, of Cannibal Holocaust fame, directed the fairly enjoyable Cut and Run, an adventure movie with a little gut munching to spice up events, and Mario Gariazzo presented Amazonia, an unexceptional tale (actually about headhunters) that still managed to successfully capture some of that savage vibe that we cannibal fans know and love.<br /><br />Michele Massimo Tarantini, meanwhile, gave us Massacre in Dinosaur Valley, a trashy (ie. it has plenty of hot nekkid women in it) B-movie style affair that totally misses the mark. With a fraction of the gore that fans have come to expect from the genre (the only memorable moment being a fun piranha attack), particularly dreadful acting, and a group of unlikeable characters you actually look forward to seeing being eaten alive, I found Tarantini's movie to be one of the weakest Italian cannibal films I have seen.<br /><br />Some viewers seem to have enjoyed this one's general shoddiness, awarding it 'so-bad, it's good' status, but I don't think it manages to pull off that particular trick. In fact, part of me suspects that Massacre in Dinosaur Valley was intentionally made to be bad. Which doesn't make it good. Just bad. Which I guess, would make it a success.

              "  b'\"Believers\" is your very average end of the world/suicide cult movie if not for the fact that it was directed by Daniel Myrick, one half of the director duo behind \"The Blair Witch Project\", if only Mr. Myrick had used one half of his brain too then this might not have ended up such a total mess.<br /><br />Obviously, the Hollywood producers didn\\'t trust the film-making skills of the \"Blair Witch\" creators, since, they both have been virtually inactive in the new millennium so far. Still, it seems that Myrick had enough time on his hands to hatch a few cinematic eggs. Since last year, he was not only producing \"Rest Stop\" (which I kind of liked) but also directed another three feature length movies (\"The Objective\", \"Solstice\" and \"The Strand\"). Although, it remains to be seen whether they will make it beyond a straight-to-video release. As for \"Believers\" it pretty much follows the formula of \"The Blair Witch Project\", but while the twist in that movie consisted of surpassing our fear that the witch was real in \"Believers\" we are introduced to a bunch of frauds that in the very end... I really don\\'t want to spoil it for you here, because the movie has not much else going for it than the twist ending, and even that twist is paper thin, almost as if Kevin Costner at the end of \"Water World\" had found out that he belonged to the latest Sea World attraction (no, it\\'s actually not THAT bad). The story of \"Believers\" is about two paramedics who are on an emergency call to rescue a woman lying conveniently in front of a gas station, having some sort of a heart attack. Subsequently, David Vaughn and his partner Victor are abducted by a bunch of weirdos who take them inside an old bunker where their fellow cult members reside. I forgot the name of the cult, it\\'s probably some Greek letter of the alphabet. From there on, it\\'s pretty much business as usual. There\\'s the sinister end of the world cult and it\\'s mysterious cult leader, lots of teaching and indoctrination, members who try to escape but are caught (the woman with the heart attack and here little daughter), some attempted brainwashing of the paramedics, large gas canisters with the required bio-hazard warnings all over them and a lot of mumbo jumbo about numbers and how God can be found in science and such. The story arch, if you can call it that, largely consists of Vaughn\\'s partner Victor having a spiritual crisis and slowly turning over to the dark side (hey, it\\'s a character driven movie!). A lot of hokey acting is involved in that process and finally culminates in a scene where Victor gets to bang a hot cult member chick. Well, who can resist the power of love? Overall, this is a fairly weak effort to give a new spin on the old evil suicide cult story, which would have worked a lot better as a short movie instead of a feature length film. The material is too second rate and the actor\\'s are too third rate to carry this anywhere but the nearest lowest price blockbuster bargain bin. There is too much focus on the twist ending and not enough substance to sustain it. In order for the twist to succeed the movie has to lull the audience into the belief, that there are religious fanatics at work here like we\\'ve seen them a thousand times on TV and congregating in the living room of our neighbor\\'s house. The \"show them something ordinary and at the end reveal that they have witnessed something extraordinary\"-formula usually works better in the short form. Here, the cult\\'s religion is not intriguing enough to merit any second thoughts as to whether their predictions about an imminent doomsday might actually be true and grounded in hard evidence. ***imminent spoiler ahead*** Finally, when that doomsday arrives - oops? did I spoil anything? - it\\'s a mere afterthought to a poorly digested potpourri of religious fanaticism and spiritual sci-fi. Thus, it also confirms my impression upon viewing the \"The Blair Witch Project\", namely, that its strength comes from its fraudulent direction, since, there was no direction at all. Unfortunately, for S\\xc3\\xa1nchez and Myrick that means that they will be forever condemned to have directed only one great movie, which is great only because it pretends not to have been directed at all. That might turn out to be the true curse of the Blair Witch.',\n",
              "  b'Spoilers? Maybe a few details, but nothing too plot related. Not like it would matter with this movie. <br /><br />Air Rage blatantly rips off the mid-air infiltration premise of Executive Decision. Ice-T leads a team of four \"elite\" commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics (similar to what 3rd graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground) lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire. <br /><br />What entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look-alike has-been actors. You\\'ll immediately recognize Cyril O\\'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked, though it was so long ago that you probably won\\'t be able to place it (it was Porky\\'s). Here Cyril plays a decent knock-off of a Bill Paxton character. Most Hilarious is porker Gil Gerard, who\\'s so fat that you will never recognize him as TV\\'s Buck Rogers. Instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past, Gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona, which was clearly imagineered for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid look-alike performance as a Chuck Connors/Kirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T\\'s acting has deteriorated remarkably. It\\'s not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized. <br /><br />One of the items that plays into this movie is a CD-ROM of classified information. It\\'s being hand carried, and it\\'s apparently and unbelievably not encrypted, despite the security-savvy aura of Gerard\\'s NSA character. What a joke. I\\'m severely doubting that the information purported to be on the CD would ever even all be assembled into a portable format. <br /><br />Despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers, the gunfire is about as loud as canned air, and causes nary a person to flinch, so apparently no foley budget. The assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny. The flight attendant\\'s use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. When she takes intuitively to the mini-Uzi pistol, which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever, that\\'s just too stupid. A true elite team would carry MP-5s for this type thing or maybe SOCOMM .45s, or even customized Hi- Powers if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school... The lame-o standard issue 92Fs are totally unbelievable, having lost most of their cool after Lethal Weapon I. The bad guys, supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types, have an assorted mixture of absurdity, like the aforementioned mini-Uzi pistol and a Tec-9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extender that isn\\'t a silencer. <br /><br />There was one touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other reviewers: The flight attendant and Ice-T did lower the craft to 10,000 feet for \"breathable air\" before they opened the door. And I also got the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to get the door closed, that she basically just gave up on that point. As far as the landing, there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown. Sigh. <br /><br />Only the Dukes of Hazard eluding Roscoe P. Coltrane at the \"pass\" could shame this movie for use of stock footage. They obviously chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they couldn\\'t get stock of an F-117. Aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001, let\\'s also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B-2, and that at point blank range... Well, I\\'m no expert, but I\\'m having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on Radar. <br /><br />As others have pointed out, the repeated references to \"F-15s\" when they were showing F -16s was laughable. Details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with, not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. <br /><br />Wow. What a show. Catch it on Stars or something. Don\\'t pay to rent it, but do watch it for laughs. In contention for worst movie ever, right up there with No Holds Barred, which at least had some originality.',\n",

Watch the episode Die, Hippy Die, and this film eerily mimics that overly clich\\xc3\\xa9d plot line. A small difference, however-South Park is meant to parody. This film was also a testament to how badly Lucy Lawless needs work. My god, Xena, how the mighty have fallen. One positive, however, is that this film really made me and my friends laugh like crazy.

              "  b'I first saw this film 5 years ago as a University student when it originally came out. I still remember how impressed I was afterward. I told my sister who was with me at the time, \"I think that is the BEST Bollywood film I have seen so far\". I recently saw this film again, and I remembered again why I loved it SO much the first time. This movie is a credit to Farhan Akhtar who has since directed the spectacular movie \"Lakshya\".He is a true talent to contend with in Bollywood,and certain more experienced directors, can take a leaf off his book. <br /><br />\"Dil Chata Hain\" works on SO many levels. It\\'s an attempt at telling a mature story. NOT the same old plot exhausted to death, and no \"over blown\" Bhangra numbers either! The movie was content and script driven. It explores the many faces of love, and the changes that occur in friendships as people mature and move on with life. But what it shows also is that true friendship can overcome many an adversity, misunderstanding, and even time.The first movie about \"Male-bonding\" to come out of Bollywood!<br /><br />So beautifully told, this story captures the lives and loves of Akash, Sameer and Sidhart (Sid). Played brilliantly by Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Akshay Khanna.They are supported by Dimple Kapadia, Preity Zinta & Sonali Kulkarni. All the main actors give their best in this movie, and I cannot say one thing negative about any of their performances. (Except maybe that Sonali didn\\'t have enough to do). The movie also includes a few characters that have only a few scenes to play but they play them well, and they ALL add value to the story. <br /><br />This movie was the turning point in Saif\\'s career. Since DCH, he has gone from strength to strength, and his versatility as an actor has finally been recognized. As for Aamir Khan... what can I say? His performances are always stellar,as he is a \"thinking\" actor who gives his all to a character he plays.I have yet to see a \"bad performance\" given by Aamir. He never does things by half. Akshay is great and he too has always given fine performances in all his movies to date! Preity and Dimple play the next most prominent characters in the movie. Preity gave a very controlled performance, and Dimple was superb. She gave this movie that extra bit of \"Oommf\". I also love the way the story did not portray a clich\\xc3\\xa9d relationship between an older women, and younger man, and how they kept both the characters dignity in tact. <br /><br />The Akash-Shalini love story was touching too,as these are two people who never intended to fall in love with each other,but did.Akash,who does not believe in love, and Shalini, who is engaged to her surrogate parent\\'s son.The scene in which her father tells Akash, \"please look after her, as she is my daughter\" was very emotional.But the best part was that it was not \"over-dramatized\".The emotions of the moment created it\\'s own drama. <br /><br />All in all, this was a \"coming of age\" story.In the end, we see the three characters two years later, in the same place in Goa where they spend that last summer of youth together.At this point though,they have come full circle, and have moved on from \"boys to men\".We feel their maturity come through as they sit their talking,even though non of them say anything profound. <br /><br />In conclusion,all I can say is PLEASE make more intelligent and enlightening movies like this one!<br /><br />Farhan,very well done indeed!All the best!',\n",

(And don\\'t get me wrong this movie is BAD, but its occasionally as low as you can go in badness and still be enjoyable in a jaw dropping sort of way.)

              "  b'Hercules Unchained picks up right where Hercules (1958) left off. Hercules and his new bride, Iole, are headed to Thebes. A fight for the throne between two brothers puts a kink in Hercules\\' plans, so he decides to act as peacemaker. But before he can carry out his mission, he mistakenly drinks from the \"waters of forgetfulness\" and is taken prisoner by Queen Omphale. Unsure of his real identity, Hercules is at the Queen\\'s mercy and is reduced to being her plaything. Meanwhile, Iole is caught between the warring brothers and faces death. Can Hercules come to his senses in time to save his wife and his beloved Thebes? <br /><br />Hercules Unchained is one of those instances where I find the sequel superior to the original. First off, the movie is just more interesting. The original Hercules had a tendency to drag. While Hercules Unchained isn\\'t a thrill-a-minute, there is certainly more action. Second, I think everyone involved from the actors to the director seemed more comfortable in their respective roles in the sequel. That\\'s only natural. Finally, and probably most importantly, Mario Bava\\'s influence is more pronounced and evident in Hercules Unchained. There are instances throughout the movie that show his touch. For example, when Hercules meets the old king in the cave, the use of colored gel lighting in the scene simply screams Bava. Take a look at that scene and compare it with what Bava would do in his on Hercules movie, Hercules in the Haunted World, and see if you don\\'t agree.<br /><br />A lot of different muscle-bound actors would play the role of Hercules in these Italian productions, but none would do it any better that Steve Reeves. In this instance, the original is still the best. Others cast in the role may have been better actors and some may have been more gifted physically, but few could combine the two into a single package as effectively as Reeves.<br /><br />I realize that these Italian sword and sandal movies may not be for everyone, but I really get a kick out of most of them. For anyone new to these movies, Hercules Unchained would make an excellent jumping off point.',\n",

It wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the dumb thing and I didn't enjoy one single moment! Not even one. How did this script get greenlighted.

The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some, but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes, disturbs, and haunts with the question: What does an evil person look like?<br /><br />Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily... forgotten.',\n",

It looked like it might be good from the box, but I must say again: nothing about this movie even resembled good.

There's not much to say about this one; every single gag falls completely flat - even though it's parodying a lot of the same flicks that Not Another Teen Movie went after. The actors seem to be trying, but with a script this horrible, Marlon Brando himself (and I'm talking old school Brando, not The Island of Dr. Moreau Brando here) would've come off amateurish.

              "  b'The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /><br />Like \"The Man From Planet X,\" this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing. Meaning, we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction. And yes, it\\'s another \"classic\" released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound--by Midnite Movies.<br /><br />So, the main reason to watch this film? Oh, it\\'s definitely the whole time our space crew is on Mars. (What, you thought \"Angry Red Planet\" referred to Neptune?) Prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship, inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the \"puny female\" member of the crew. It\\'d be somewhat offensive by today\\'s standards if it weren\\'t so damn funny. But Mars is the real reason we\\'re watching this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars is screaming bloody red. It\\'s filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness. It\\'s really quite a sight\\xc2\\x97as are the (ha ha) aliens viewers are to witness. The best being the \"ratbatspidercrab.\" You think that\\'s a joke? That\\'s what they call it in the movie! It\\'s a gigantic chimera (small puppet) of a thing combining traits of rats, bats, spiders, and crabs. It bounds along all puppety and scares the sh*t out of our \"heroic crew.\" There are other weird, and poorly imagined, aliens to be seen, but that one takes the cake. Eventually, after their harrowing experience on Mars, the sexist crew boards their \"ship\" and returns to whatever planet it was they came from.<br /><br />This ain\\'t for everyone.

Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with this one (if they never got to it on the show).<br /><br />2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia score, 4/10 overall.<br /><br />(www.ResidentHazard.com)',\n",

Yet he manages to keep producing films of an extremely high standard AND creating different and interesting techniques. Izo is another fine example of this.<br /><br />The broken structure is far more complex than Nolan's 'Memento' and far more effective as it allows you to experience the agony that Izo is constantly feeling.<br /><br />The constant metaphors that keep popping up throughout the non-stop carnage bring more layers to the film than any 'shock' movie yet Miike still manages to throw in a few gallons of blood and a very interesting place to hide a sword (ladies) for good measure.<br /><br />So in summary a very poignant anti-war piece with some fine visual styles and some very brutal action. And a great guitarist.<br /><br />Go see. And take the whole family. <br /><br />Cinema at its best.\",\n",

              "  b'I saw this film last night at the Midwest Indy Film Fest in Chicago. I commend the filmmakers on a beautiful and challenging story and wonderful execution. I strongly disagreed with the length and labored approach in the final edit. I agree with the director that languor and easy films are needed in our fast pace world, yet, here the length is doing your film a disservice. The film lover next to me fell asleep! I struggled to keep interested.<br /><br />As filmmakers you need to take a stand with your beliefs, but you need to realize the risks. Does this particular film need to be 39 minutes, 37, 22? Is that worth endearing the film to this part of the audience, while, this part of the audience falls asleep? I bring this up because I feel the film will lose nothing, and gain so much more, if it was tighter. The idea that you need a labored approach for this heavy theme is not a valid argument. Roman Polanski\\'s \"Two Men and a Wardrobe\" is soaked with rich themes and is 15 minutes. Marcell Ivanyi\\'s \"Wind\" is spell binding in the themes it introduces at 6 minutes.<br /><br />Ultimately, the short film is a unique artform, complex and ever changing. There is a certain social contract that exists between filmmaker and audience on what that artform is. What is the general public perception on the range of length of the short film artform? Do you feel the labored edit of your story is justified by the power of the third act and the direction of the characters arc? Why do some people enjoy the pace of \"Lost in Translation\" but fall asleep here? You can break those conditions whenever you like, and I hope you do, just recognize the risk.<br /><br />To end on a good note, I like your effort now; I\\'ll love your film after a tighter edit.',\n",

              "  b\"London to Brighton is a superb slice of British crime pulp; a no nonsense, down and dirty tale of two relatively weak individuals, given the parameters of the genre, desperate to get away from the lifestyle they've grim-and-bared up until this point. Systematically, one particular character must balance evading capture with the taking on of the moral responsibilities that come with looking after a much younger individual they've unwittingly roped into this world by way of child-prostitution. If there is a distinct shrill ringing throughout us as the film plays out, it's because while conforming to gangster genre conventions, we see most of the world and most of the film unfold through the eyes and ultimately with two females: a very young girl and a middle aged woman, two people we feel are under threat and will have harm come to them if they're caught. This is in stark contrast to usual crime film fare; in which crime infused males can be on the run, or can owe a debt, or whatever \\xc2\\x96 but do not necessarily carry the same vulnerability. Thus, London to Brighton, with its scuzzy and raw feel, comes across as scarier; more frightening in its depiction of a world, the characters within and overall attention to genre.<br /><br />The girls on the run are twelve year old Joanne (Groome) and the much elder Kelly (Stanley), a prostitute. They're played by two actresses more familiar to televisual work and as low-down supporting roles in feature films, but here are given the chance to shine in lead roles, snapping up the opportunity in the process. Their predicament is a set up that can be pitched in little to no words, immediately getting across a sense of urgency. The film begins with the two in a public toilet; panic-stricken and acting in nervous manner; something's gone wrong and they're about to go on the run from a London based crime syndicate as those connected to the organisation chase them.<br /><br />The film gets across a sense of the sort of danger they're in without ever really showing anything, instead opting for the talk of an off screen event or individual. On this occasion, the talk of potentially of going to prison for what it is they've done is most prominent an item of which plants seeds of great worry in our minds as we observe these relatively hapless, physically out of breath with their clothes torn and clearly in a bad shape, people stumble through the seamy, low-level based locations they inhabit. The introduction of Derek (Harris), Kelly's pimp, and the potential threat that he carries as a character is only brought into perspective when it is revealed he answers further still to an individual higher up than he is; the son of the leader of this organisation. Where Derek is more extroverted and animated; Stuart (Spruell), the higher up, is calmer, dresses more formally and talks in a quieter manner which quickly pushes the boundaries out further as to whom acts as more of a threat, without taking away any of the initial menace Derek inhabits. This minute, but observed ploy, captures the film's tone of getting in deeper; of assuming something to be of a specific nature but then having to recognise a new threat, or new predicament, which furthers feelings and emotions.<br /><br />As an event which spawns the mess everyone finds themselves in, it is revealed that Joanne is a runaway wondering the streets of London, and is quickly picked up by both Derek and Kelly when it is made apparent a local crime boss, Stuart's father, wants a younger girl to feed some depraved sexual cravings. Joanne carries with her a mouth, an ability to small talk her way through conversations with adults that we truly feel she might actually possess. The locale in which she is required for whatever perverted plans are in store for her is presented by way of brilliant, white light; a blinding light that reflects off of seemingly marble walls; floors and white pillars dotted around the room. The mise-en-scene and colour gives it a disturbing sense of resembling ancient Rome, specifically in appearance; in all its rich, beautiful, robe-decked in-glory. The sheer contrast of locales between what we're presented through the cities of London and Brighton, the latter of which itself looked like a sunny; beach-housing; amusements displaying safe haven compared to London, is stark, disorientating and disturbing.<br /><br />The film really is fine feature debut, amongst the best of last decade and sits alongside works such as Donnie Darko; One Hour Photo and Memento. There's a real sense of terror in London to Brighton; an immediacy which you feel is born out of the two female leads and their place in the film working within a genre which would usually, in terms of Kelly's role as a prostitute, see them relegated to a nothing supporting role or to act as mere eye candy. Its willingness to have its women act in an independent and strong manner sees them break away from orders in a very male dominated world, that of crime, and renders them characters whom have limits; morals and know that when the line is to be drawn, it must be drawn, no matter what the consequence or whom one is dealing with. London to Brighton forms an exciting passage of film-making out of a relatively routine idea, with guided attention toward mostly all of the characters, Stuart of which goes through his own series of frightening changes later on; awareness of how the film should 'look' at very specific points and gets the best out of a low-key cast. Director Paul Williams has triumphed.\",\n",

Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release.

Jed Griffin (Michael Madison of \"Reservoir Dogs\") is taking his family\\xc2\\x97wife, teenage son, and tweener daughter\\xc2\\x97on a long overdue vacation into Vermont to ski. Meanwhile, ex-con Rudy Wicker (Jeff Wincott of \"S.W.A.T.) and his partner plan to rob a bank and make a clean getaway in a plane over the border into Canada. However, everything goes wrong when they hold up a small-town bank. First, Sheriff Bingham Hunt (Steve Adams of \"The Bone Collector\\') mortally wounds the driver of the getaway, and the vehicle careens out of control and smashes into Hunt\\'s wife Tracy (Claudia Bess of \"Strip Search\") as she is trying to give him his personal radio. Rudy gets off with what appears to be a flesh wound and races out of town. No sooner has he left the city limits than another sheriff\\'s deputy blue-lights him. When the deputy approaches the car, Rudy jumps out and guns him down, then ices his partner, and commandeers the sheriff\\'s cruiser. The grief-stricken Hunt sets out to capture and kill Rudy, but Rudy outsmarts him and hijacks Jed and his family while the protagonist is making small repairs to his 1979 motor home. Rudy gets tire of Jed\\'s sass, shoots him, and leaves him for dead on the roadside. Earlier, after Rudy shot the sheriff\\'s deputy, he not only stole his cruiser but also his jacket. Now, Rudy leaves the sheriff\\'s jacket with Jed and takes off with Jed\\'s family as his hostage. Rudy is bound and determined to reach his rendezvous point with the plane so he can get out of the country. As it turns out, when Rudy shot Jed, Rudy\\'s bullet lodged in Jed\\'s cell phone and Jed resolves to catch up to Rudy. The problem is that Jed doesn\\'t know that Sheriff Hunt is determined to kill Rudy. Moreover, when Jed tries to flag Hunt down, the sheriff sees the jacket taken off his murdered deputy and shoots first before he can confirm Jed\\'s story. Director Eric Weston juxtaposes scenes of the sheriff\\'s manhunt, Jed\\'s efforts to rescue his family, and Rudy\\'s desperate efforts to get away with the loot. Unfortunately, juxtaposing these three characters and their objectives generates no suspense. The cliff-hanger conclusion doesn\\'t add much to this paint-by-the-number nonsense. Clearly, Madison needed a paycheck. In fact, we learn nothing about Madison\\'s character because the scenarists provide him with no backstory. As this generation\\'s Robert Mitchum, Madison has great presence but he makes no impression on this second-rate actioneer. Martial arts expert Jeff Wincott adopts a different look, but his vicious killer is a nit-wit. Michelle Scarabelli effectively plays one of Hunt\\'s level-headed deputies who ensures that her hysteria-riddled sheriff doesn\\'t kill the wrong man. \"Pressure Point\" lacks pressure from start to finish and makes no point other than to burn time.',\n",

              "  b'Saw this piece of work at a film fest in CA. My god, what was the director thinking? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when making a short film. First off, this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The film takes place partially in \"The Waystation\", some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really takes place.<br /><br />THe acting is beyond bad. So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. The lead actress Julia Reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films. There is one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner but it\\'s like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue, which bordered on absurd. The writer (whom I assume is also the director) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain.<br /><br />The overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest, with a film this bad it\\'s easy to overlook it. The production design is pretty good, although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. The costumes and make-up are okay, and I understand the production was working with a low budget. It\\'s just when the characters speak, or they try and push the plot forward, the film unravels into a muck of crap.<br /><br />As I\\'ve said, this film is god awful. It\\'s like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this. My only hope is that he used other people\\'s money on this, because if he used his own, he\\'s a total sucker.',\n",
              "  b'Film sequels were a novelty in 1925, when DON Q, SON OF ZORRO marked a big profit for United Artists. Then and now, it is considered to be a better film than the original, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1920), which made star and producer Douglas Fairbanks the personification of the Swashbuckler five years earlier.<br /><br />Since his screen debut in 1915, Fairbanks had always been cast in contemporary comedies as a fun-loving, never-say-die, go-getter who gets the girl and catches the bad guys \\xc2\\x96 all the while exhibiting his athletic prowess and bravado. He was a major film actor, but his popularity was beginning to wane due to the monotony of his roles and vehicles. <br /><br />The formation of United Artists Corporation in 1919 gave founders Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith control over their own projects. Fairbanks chose this opportunity to risk reinventing his image by starring in this film adaptation of The Curse of Capistrano. The serialized novel written by Johnston McCulley had been published that year in a popular pulp magazine. It introduced the character of Zorro to the world. The magic of the movie assured Zorro\\'s place among fictional super-heroes. The character lived on in several more film versions as well as books, comics, cartoons, Halloween costumes, toys, and in the popular 1950\\'s television series starring Guy Williams.<br /><br />In THE MARK OF ZORRO, set in early 19th century California, Fairbanks came up with an ingenious concept \\xc2\\x96 showcasing his likable contemporary stock character into an action/adventure period costume picture. He plays Don Diego Vega, the milksop son of an affluent rancher who, like the Scarlet Pimpernel, dons a disguise to defend the impoverished townsfolk from the tyrants in power. His alter ego Zorro\\'s, (Spanish for fox) trademarks are the black cape and cowl mask he wears and the master swordsmanship he displays. He is known to brand his victims with a \"Z\" made with three fast strokes of his blade. At the end of the film, after Zorro\\'s greatest triumph, his identity is revealed. He throws his sword into the air. It lodges into a high spot on the wall, as Zorro shouts, \"Till I need you again!\" Though it was probably not Fairbanks\\' intention at the time, this line was a prime set-up for a sequel if there ever was one. <br /><br />After the tremendous financial and critical success of ZORRO, Fairbanks continued to give the public what it wanted \\xc2\\x96 the charismatic Fairbanks persona in lavish period epics. THE THREE MUSKETEERS, ROBIN HOOD and THE THIEF OF BAGDAD were all released in the years between the two Zorro epics.<br /><br />As one can easily discern by the title of this follow-up, Doug is back as Diego\\'s son - namely Don Cesar, aka \"Don Q.\" The screenplay is based on the novel \"Don Q\\'s Love Story\" by Hesketh Prichard and Kate Prichard which had no relationship to Zorro at all. But by making Don Q the offspring of the famous hero, it cashed in on the audience\\'s familiarity with the original and made it possible for Doug to play a dual role as both father and son.<br /><br />In the family tradition, Don Cesar is sent to Spain to continue his education and learn the traditions of his ancestors. His high-spirited ways and showmanship with a bullwhip make him a favorite of the Queen\\'s cousin, Archduke Paul of Austria (Warner Oland). Cesar also makes an enemy of surly Don Sebastian (Donald Crisp), a member of the Queen\\'s guard, and both men fall for the beautiful Dolores de Muro (Mary Astor). After Cesar is framed for murder, he fakes suicide and goes underground until he can prove the guilt of the real killer. Meanwhile, in California, Don Diego receives word of his son\\'s predicament. He retrieves his sword from where it had stuck thirty years before, digs out his mask and cape and travels to Spain to help rescue his son. Father and son take on 15 soldiers in a sword fight during the film\\'s exuberant finale. <br /><br />Audiences and critics alike loved DON Q even more than the original. Film-making technique and technology had improved rapidly since 1920. The sequel had a stronger plot, higher production values and better pacing. What\\'s more, Fairbanks has fine-tuned his swashbuckler persona to perfection. He was never was he more cocksure, flamboyant and amusing than he appears here. Though already 41 years old, he easily got away with playing a much younger character in no small part due to his physical fitness. He is shown to great advantage, engaging in sword-play, jumping on a horse or \\xc2\\x96 his specialty in this film - cracking a whip. Well known for performing his own stunts, Doug reportedly spent six weeks learning fancy whipmanship. He uses it to light a cigarette, extinguish a candle, slice paper, lasso a bull and swing onto a balcony. He also shows himself to be a dandy on the dance floor in a parody of a Valentino tango.<br /><br />Donald Crisp, best known for his chilling performance as Lillian Gish\\'s cruel father in BROKEN BLOSSOMS, does double duty in DON Q as both co-star and director. He plays Fairbanks\\' dastardly nemesis Don Sebastian while directing one of his best films. Crisp directed more than 70 films, including the Buster Keaton classic,THE NAVIGATOR.

              "  b'I have no idea what on earth, or beyond, could have possibly made Sam Mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, I see no reason why it should not be at #1 on the Bottom 100. For although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (#5 at the time of this publication), I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound, because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made. By contrast, everything, and I do mean everything, in this film is completely unprofessional.<br /><br />The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Right\\'s supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays. And I do emphasize \"intended.\" Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar. Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple\\'s struggle against a society that largely opposes them, it creates tired, crass stereotypes of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, the namesake couple, are portrayed as two crude, sex-starved, and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so. This meets with the opposition of Ben\\'s brother Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians (as this movie would have us believe), is loud, prying, stupid, and violent. He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think that\\'s dreadful (it is), you haven\\'t seen it all.<br /><br />The actors (?) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video. But not even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker, for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie. Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote. For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother\\'s homosexuality. But instead of portraying this idea clearly, he spits out the stupid, utterly confusing, whiny-sounding line, \"You know what, I\\'m never going to have any nieces or nephews, okay, because you\\'re so F***ED UP!\"<br /><br />Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values. Yes, I know this ain\\'t The Dark Knight, but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing. For example, six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds. People do not teleport across a room between takes. And objects do not fall FORWARD when shot! <br /><br />Do not waste your money on Ben & Arthur. I don\\'t care if you\\'re 7, 17, or 107. I don\\'t care if you\\'re gay, straight, bi, or undecided. I don\\'t care if you\\'re \"just curious.\" I don\\'t care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung-heap. Stay away, far away. This movie\\'s only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a Frisbee.',\n",

Director Casper Andreas, who also had a hand in the script, hopes to titillate and shock his target audience with bitchy, outr\\xc3\\xa9 dialogue and flashes of naked behinds; unfortunately, this isn't anything any filmmaker treading in queer-cinema waters hasn't tried before. The acting is so wooden, with casting choices apparently made on who had the best pecs, that one can only scoff at these smarmy returns. This is just the thing to kill off the gay comedy-drama. It shows no imagination, no sensitivity, no subtext, no sense of satire or self-parody. When a gay couple squabbles and breaks up for the night, it's merely for the most basic and childish reasons.

In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. <br /><br />It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.\",\n",

Serving a mission for the Church is a rather common experience - what would make this man\\'s mission interesting? And would any non-Mormon be interested?<br /><br />I was surprised at how interesting it was to me, but wondered how interesting it would be for non-Mormons. The story, although in a Mormon setting, was a very human story with several surprises, moments of courage, demonstrations of testing personal commitment against temptation, and an endearing love story. I loved the actors - from the main stars to the peripherals, it was high quality all around.<br /><br />Throughout the film I kept asking myself: how would I have acted in this situation?

Therefore watching a horror film, I primarily want to be scared. The Grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. I've been a horror film fan for many years, and I'm talking about the masters such as Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days.

The fact that all the furniture, the flowers and other things are alive and have faces, it makes this show all the more entertaining and weird. The rest of my family love this too, especially my mum, I think it's her favourite children's TV series! :O I think people who didn't like this are missing something and just focus a little too much on the not-so-good points of things.

              "  b\"<br /><br />This is probably one of the best sonic games I have ever played! I can tell you right now that this unlike almost all Sonic The Hedgehog games for various reasons. First off, this game was not really meant for kids for various different reasons. For starters, some of the comments made in the game are not ones I would think younger kids would understand. Also, the plot was very complicated for younger kids. Another thing, Rouge The Bat tore away from all Sonic games, making it very obvious that the creator had intended it to be for fans now who were fans from the very begining. Some of the biggest fans are from 15-25, so that's where I'm guessing Rouge came from. Rouge is a sexy, sassy. .Bat that uses looks and more to get her way. Not only that, but a costume she aquires later is a very. .SHOWY costume! I also must say that the ending game was most likely NOT meant for kids. Let's put it this way, so I don't give anything away, Dr. Gerald Robotnik makes his little speech, then people in the background start screaming things that would familiar to older audiences.<br /><br />Anyway, enough with why the game was not really meant for kids. Let's move onto the good additions to the game! I must say, I was really impressed with the graphics in this game! Everything was full of detail, down the very last leaf on a tree! In fact, most of the game was almost in completely rendered 3-D. Unfortunately, there weren't as many cool cut scenes like Sonic Adventure had with perfect, realistic animation. Another great thing about this game was the music. Every characters level had the same type of music, that was VERY well organized. Sonic gets regular rock music, Tails gets some sort of hippie music, Knuckles gets really great hip hop music, Shadow gets total techno feed music, Eggman gets techno mixed in with heavy metal, and Rouge gets very catchy jazz music. I must say that Rouge's music was so catchy that I walk around humming her music. Another great addition to this game were the characters Shadow and Rouge, which were awesome characters! I really hope that Shadow ends up getting his own video game series after this. Rouge was great, but she could have been better. Sure she could hunt better than Knuckles and run faster than Sonic, but being a bat, she still couldn't walk on ceilings or use any supersonic waves that bats would use. Plus, a glitch about the game, is that she flies in cut scenes, yet she can only glide when you play as her. However, she WAS a great addition to the game, and I would love to see her come back!<br /><br />Well, in general, Sonic Adventure 2 is probably one of the best games I have played in a long time, and I look forward to Sonic Adventure 3 on the GameCube by Nintendo!\",\n",

The actors I expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point).

But there isn\\'t much of a story here anyways.<br /><br />This movie gets a 3/10 stars IMO. The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame.

              "  b\"(possible spoilers)<br /><br />Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us.<br /><br />The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are undermined<br /><br />somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much better<br /><br />use of a high budget) turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger<br /><br />(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).<br /><br />The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensively<br /><br />hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising<br /><br />campaign.<br /><br />The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). She<br /><br />seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.<br /><br />Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their<br /><br />stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,<br /><br />manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today.

The sudden presence of a transnational company (that is ruthless, no matter if its officials claim the opposite) in those countries, where political corruption, greed and totalitarian methods helped to mine its social and economic system, has very little to laugh about. On top of that, foreign official in Georgia Pier Lewis, who constantly makes fun of the company\\'s methods (as cutting power for a few minutes in an airport for not paying its bills, when a plane was about to land) and the Georgian people\\'s reactions, is a rather pathetic character, making one wonder if he\\'s ever heard the word humanism. 2/10.',\n",

Director Simon Bellows uses slick video-editing and electronic music to accompanie the martial-arts and gun battles & he does a solid job w/ what he has to work with. <br /><br />Beware, even though I saw this on USA cable network edited, it is still a pretty violent flick w/ suggested sex & f-bombs ( I could tell what they just said even though it was bleeped out on regular T.V.) so I recommend this for more mature viewers. <br /><br />Rent it or watch it when it airs on T.V. because it\\'s a decent hour-and-a-half of your time.',\n",

Apparently all his energy went into \"Nemesis\" which was an entertaining non-stop action movie, and had a much more expensive look. \"Knights\" is clunky and cheesy, a bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game (new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at the time (58), I hope his stunt double was well paid. (*1/2)',\n",

I had been quite pleased with The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and think the Harry Potter adaptations were fairly good. To my utter disgust the movie started with a young boy with an MP3 player. I was ready to walk out then but decided to stick with it. Then came a long drawn out boring introduction to various family members I can not even be bothered to remember. When things started to happen the special effects were fine, but the whole way through I kept wondering if Susan Cooper was dead to allow this to happen to her book.<br /><br />I am sorry but if people think that unless a film is set in the current day people won't be interested in it then we are letting ourselves sadly down. The setting for the book held half of the mystery as did the time when it occurred. Is anyone really going to believe that a missing twin brother is going to suddenly appear and no one is going to question it.<br /><br />If this was an attempt to enter the market the Potter and Narnia series have created then it is very poorly done. Unfortunately it sets the scene and tone for the rest of the books and if they try to set them correctly people are going to get confused.

              "  b\"One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's, Scarface is very much a film of its time. The first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you, 'made in 1983'. The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. This is still a superb film. While Georgio Moroder's music has dated a fair bit, it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma, one of two films that he has made with Pacino (the other being the fantastic Carlito's Way). All of De Palma's trademarks are here; the strong language, the graphic violence (more on that later), the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work.<br /><br />Pacino dominates the film and I mean that literally. He is the dominant star of this film. His performance over the top, this is one of those films were Pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them, this time with a superb Cuban accent. However, this is Pacino and he does it fantastically. Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact. While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all, this is an excessive film. Take a look at the production design of Tony's house, take a look at the violence in this film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films. Take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so Pacino's performance I suppose is perfect for the film. He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way. Steven Bauer, in particularly, as Manny, Tony's best friend, is the stand out of the supporting cast. His performance is so controlled and quiet in a De Niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn. Michelle Pfeiffer, of course, adds the glamor, Robert Loggia adds gravitas as usual and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great debut as Tony's sister.<br /><br />Of course this is more than just a film about excess. There is more to it than drugs, violence, chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out. This is a film about the darker side of the American dream. In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films. Tony finds himself coming to America, getting it all, living the American dream and then losing it all in violent fashion, and by saying he loses it all, I mean he loses it all. He kills his best friend, his sister is killed, his empire crumbles, literally, around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion, bullets ripping through him. <br /><br />Without doubt Scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's. Sure, it doesn't have the subtleties of The Godfather films, but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again.\",\n",

              "  b'Recently I was looking for the newly issued Wide Screen DVD of FLY AWAY HOME and came upon interesting title that I had never heard of: GREY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough Film caught my attention (he responsible for such fine films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN, and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the screenplay was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This \"Special Edition\" was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under $10.00 -- so I chanced it & bought it. WOW! What a beautiful film. Pierce Brosnan stars as Archie Grey Owl, a real life trapper in the 1930s, who came to love and respect the wild lands of Canada, and worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond film) gives a shaded, warm, powerful performance as does Annie Galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land -- especially the beaver. A fine score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photograhy by Roger Pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film. AND the extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real Grey Owl as well as audio commentary tracks by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine additions PLUS options for those having access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GREY OWL has been released directly to DVD in the United States -- a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood\\'s lack of interest in distributing something that isn\\'t loaded with a lot of violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion -- and a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GREY OWL is a very fine film -- worth checking out! This is one I look forward to sharing with others.',\n",
              "  b'Visually stunning, as Bava\\'s work usually was, \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" offers the blueprint that would be used for all types of gory body count movies, especially the slasher craze of the late 70s & early 80s. Although he\\'d made similar films before (such as \"Blood and Black Lace\" and even \"Kill, Baby, Kill\"), never before had he been this explicit in his violence. The emphasis here was not only on the violent murders, but the bloody details.<br /><br />The rather loose plot is centered on a lovely bay belonging to a Countess. In a stunning opening, she is murdered, and then just as quickly, her murderer is murdered by an unseen third party. At stake is the ownership of the valuable bay property, and it\\'s something that a number of people would kill for. In fact, apparently everybody would kill for it. A series of gruesome murders is set in motion, each one more outlandish than the last, to the point where when a simple strangulation takes place late in the film, the viewer is shocked at the restraint.<br /><br />Bava\\'s inventive camera tricks have never been more appealing than here, not to mention the detailed color schemes he gets going. I was shocked to learn that this movie was not shot in a wooded area, as Bava has made it appear, but rather the woods were simulated by clever camera angles and random branches held in front of the camera. No matter how, he created a convincing atmosphere of isolation. From the opening scene, which takes place in a secluded mansion on a stormy night, Bava\\'s setting is both exotic and menacing. The murders are shocking enough, but even more disturbing is the way Bava lingers over the death throes of the victims in an almost pornographic way. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen anything quite so gruesome as a particular murder here that involves a character getting a machete embedded in his face. Even though it was duplicated in several other films (both \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Friday the 13th Part 2\"), never was it so gut wrenchingly realized.<br /><br />Only a few things spoil the ride here, and admittedly they are rather major. The plot is quite convoluted, so much that I gave up trying to figure out what was going on. Unlike Jason\\'s mindless rampages, these murders have multiple perpetrators and motivations driving them, not to mention the scheming and double-crossing that takes place here. Then there\\'s the conclusion, which is somewhat unsatisfying. While none of the situations are especially realistic, Bava\\'s wrap-up here is absolutely absurd and jokey, whereas the film\\'s tone was not like this until the last few moments.<br /><br />Overall though, I don\\'t care about any of that. \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" is outstanding enough to rise above it, and Bava gives us enough to go on that all I can remember is being overwhelmed by his visuals and the perverse spectacle of 13 bizarre death scenes all in one movie.',\n",
              "  b\"Unless I'm sadly mistaken, I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video, I'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors, at the end of it, and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now, but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos. There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits, and they're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes. What could make a rap group look more foolish I can't imagine.<br /><br />(spoilers) At any rate, I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version, so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series. The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2, with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands. Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in, then runs to the bathroom, the sink's handles turn into Freddy's hands and attack her, and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists. From there, the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment. <br /><br />`Larry' Fishburne, tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles, was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice-guy orderly, stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little. Not surprisingly, he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie. Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor, but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film. The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists. All of them are cynical and uncooperative, almost none believing that they really belong there at all. Eventually, they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria.<br /><br />Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson, this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger. Not surprisingly, she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients, since she had experienced exactly what they're going through. There are some interesting murders in this installment, and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump. There is a gigantic, worm-like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole, there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV, but there is also an unconvincing go-motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger's skeleton, which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard. And one of the more groan-inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream (the one famous for sleepwalking), tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet. Ouch.<br /><br />We get a peek into Freddy's past in this installment. Not only do we meet his mother, but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs. In fighting Freddy, the patients all band together and, in their dreams, use their special powers (most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life) to fight him. One student, bound to a wheelchair, is able to walk in his dreams, another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the `Wizard Master,' another is `beautiful and bad' (she has lots of makeup, her hair stands up in a foot-high Mohawk, and she has knives). Clever, but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients, the one who can't speak, not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie, when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams (at just the right moment to save the day). His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long, but collectively, now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors.<br /><br />Altogether, this is not an entirely weak entry into the series. The acting is pretty shoddy, but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie. Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast, displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career, and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two \\xc2\\x96 a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films. The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension, which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil. But then again, not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed, or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives. But it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones\\xc2\\x85\",\n",
              "  b\"Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon starts aboard a plane full of American high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in Japan, unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the Himalayas. Unlucky really. With some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes. However just when they think their luck couldn't get any worse they soon discover that a huge, hairy Yeti type Abominable Snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all. Trapped, cold, starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time?<br /><br />Yeah, with a title like Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the Sci-Fi Channel has made yet another 'Creature Feature' although to give these things a bit of variety the Sci-Fi Channel here in the UK are now dubbing them as a 'Beast Feast'! As if that will make any difference. Directed by Paul Ziller one has to say that Yeti: Curse of the Snow Deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time, sure it's bad but it's sort of fun at times too. The basic premise is alright actually, it's a sort of cross between Alive (1993) with it's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer Bigfoot (another legendary hairy monster) exploitation flick Night of the Demon (1980) which I would defend with my last breath & I have to say it's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as I said it's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written. The character's are mostly annoying American teens, there's the expected arguing, there's the macho hero, the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there's no prizes for originality. There are some plot holes too, if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them? How are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes? Why did the Yeti not kill that bird at the end? It had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her? The 'there are actually two Yeti's running around' twist isn't used to any effect at all either. At least there's a good pace about the film, it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & I never found myself becoming bored with it. There's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not.<br /><br />The one thing you can always say about these Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Features' or 'Beast Feasts' is that the CGI computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again. The plane crash at the start looks awful & the Yeti when it's CGI looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it's on a pogo stick. There one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm, a squashed head, a ripped out heart, some dead bodies, some blood splatter & the best bit when the Yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped-off legs before biting a big chunk out of them. According to the IMDb the actor playing the Yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make-up which seems like a long time since it's actually a pretty tatty looking creation. Apparently the original title was Raksha: Curse of the Snow Demon with Raksha meaning demon in Tibetan Sanskrit, so now you know.<br /><br />This has reasonable production values considering the usual Sci-Fi Channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh, bleak Himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm. The acting isn't that good & I didn't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn't help.<br /><br />Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon is another terrible Sc-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' if I am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it's not very good.\",\n",
              "  b'David Milch wrote DEADWOOD like nobody else writes anything: Dictated, open-source and interactive; just-in-time inventory created nearly on-the-spot so actors and crew could barely get it executed. Nearly everyone who can read has been subjected to lessons in civics and history in which glowing images of founding fathers and inspired visionaries brought forth upon this continent a new nation... <br /><br />I think DEADWOOD is an antidote for all manner of propaganda, because it was pointedly intended to illustrate the evolution of orderly society from anarchy. It might have been set 2000 years ago at the conclusion of Republican Rome, but HBO already had something similar scheduled. So Milch turned to a more contemporary point in time in which thousands of imaginations snapped toward The Black Hills, impassioned by an American Dream of personal wealth (The Golden Rule) and beat an amoral path to get (and keep) theirs\\' first, in yet another time of violent transition. Custer died the day the telephone was first publicly demonstrated. Odd. <br /><br />Ironically, the rule of gold and the search for color drew damaged, self-serving anarchists together in a bizarre perversion of selfishness that came to strongly resemble civic pride and benevolent altruism. At least, that\\'s what DEADWOOD presents to me in the form of a truly fascinating entertainment that also unmakes the familiar, laconic Hollywood Western hero, who was the self-censored product of 30s Hollywood moguls\\' anticipatory auto-antisemitism. <br /><br />About a year ago, David Milch presented many of his DEADWOOD intentions to an audience at M.I.T., in the form of a riveting interview. More clearly than in two seasons of DVD commentaries, he justifies his use of profanity in the series, explains his resistance to modern settings, and places the responsibility for understanding the DEADWOOD phenomenon on the audience, because the networks can\\'t be bothered to re-educate anybody. In This class, there will be no yawning. <br /><br />Please check it out. Just drop \"Milch MIT\" into a search engine, and you\\'ll be streaming the 83minute free interview in no time.',\n",
              "  b\"Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere is an exploitation thriller which mixes the laid-back hippie attitudes of the 60s with the permissive approach to cinematic sex and violence of the 70s. It comes from Italian director Umberto Lenzi, at the junction where his career was steering away from adventure and thriller movies and sailing into gorier, more controversial waters. Ultimately Lenzi would offend the world with films like Mangiati Vivi! (a.k.a Eaten Alive), and the notoriously sickening Cannibal Ferox. At least Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere isn't particularly offensive or nasty \\xc2\\x96 it's just a routine thriller with a splash of sex and nudity, obvious plot developments, a fashionably downbeat ending, and a toe-tapping soundtrack that is blissfully unrelated to the events on screen!<br /><br />Dick (Ray Lovelock) and Ingrid (Ornella Muti) are a young Scandinavian couple travelling around Europe. They pay their way by selling pornographic photos of themselves. Unfortunately for them, their scheme is uncovered by the somewhat unforgiving Italian police and they are instructed to leave Italy at once. On their way to the border, their car runs out of petrol and they are forced to seek help at a large, secluded villa. Here they meet Barbara Slater (Irene Papas), wife of the NATO colonel who owns the villa. Barbara seems edgy and nervous, especially when she finds them attempting to steal her husband's petrol, but nevertheless invites the couple to stay. It becomes increasingly apparent that Barbara is not to be trusted. Her behaviour seems erratic and at one point she seduces Dick. The young couple slowly come to learn that Barbara has an ulterior motive for having them in her home. Seems she recently murdered her husband and has his body stashed in the trunk of his car\\xc2\\x85. now she plans to frame Dick and Ingrid for her ruthless crime.<br /><br />The film has a few interesting elements and is comparatively subtle by Lenzi's later standards. There is some attempt to set aside time for proper character development, so that the eventual misadventures which befall the protagonists carry a little more weight. The problem is that the characters are rather dull, and the actors aren't really charismatic enough to overcome this. Eugenio Alabiso edits the film quite well, using a variety of flashy techniques to create a sense of atmosphere in several scenes. But again, the central story is too weak and uninvolving \\xc2\\x96 in the end, no amount of flashy editing can overcome the film's pervasive air of dreariness. Once Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere reaches its glumly depressing climax, one realises that very little has really happened. It is a slow-burning film which doesn't build to anything of note. Collectors of these old Italian exploitation-era movies might find something to hold their interest, as will fans of the stars, but for wider audiences there's not a great deal in the film worth getting excited about.\",\n",
              "  b\"Ok, here it is: the plot: Father Tyrone. An ex-street-thug, now turned priest, is the main suspect in a murdercase, in which a girl gets killed by a mad painter. The police can't find any other suspects, and Father Tyrone is in trouble. He then tries to solve the case all by himself, and the police follow him around.<br /><br />Fun to see Dourif as the main character, and even as a genuine good guy!.. And some of the paintings were quite good actually, but I got bored of seeing too many frontally nude strippers, which I thought spoiled the movie a bit.. but it is worth watching, if you like art and/or Dourif kicking ass!\",\n",
              "  b'Well, at least it\\'s nicely filmed with some good shots of Scotland. I say, \"at least\" because this Lassie film was a huge disappointment. I grew up watching the fine television series and thought the movie - especially with the human cast featuring Edmund Gwenn, Donald Crisp and Janet Leigh - would be even better.<br /><br />Wrong. In fact, the first 30-40 minutes were so bad, I never finished the film. It was boring and annoying. Lassie is afraid of water so the dog\\'s owner, Gwenn, constantly is angry with the dog. Lassie, meanwhile, whimpers and cries the whole time. The whole thing gets irritating, fast! <br /><br />To be fair, I should have stuck with it. You just know that Lassie will overcome his fear and things will turn out well, as always, I\\'m sure it got better than the first half that I watched. Nonetheless, filmmaker should learn what sports teams realize the hard way - you have to play hard and well the whole game - not just one half and this film\\'s first half stunk enough so that at least one reviewer went home at halftime.',\n",
              "  b\"Not in sum, but every part seems familiar. It plays like a montage of previous rom coms.<br /><br />There's nothing objectionable about it, but then again there's nothing memorable either. It's blurb, a schedule filler, one in the bank.<br /><br />Pegg and Moran just sleepwalk through the same parts that they always play, not expanding their range on iota. Pegg's cringing everyman is getting quite tired now. Thandie Newton just has to stand in doorways and look pretty. Her character is a prize, not a person. The bit parts are played by the usual assortment of jobbing British actors, also on autopilot. Azaria is the strongest actor, but isn't given much of a part. His character development goes: good, good, good... evil, with no reason given for the sudden transition.<br /><br />Everything about it, Schwimmer's direction included, is just... adequate. There's no snap, no pizazz, and no chemistry between any of the actors, something that becomes painfully obvious when listening to the awkward stilted commentary track. Film making by box ticking. <br /><br />The whole is instantly forgettable, and dreadfully disappointing given the collection of talent working on it.\",\n",
              "  b'An idealistic doctor, Paul Henreid, is a counselor or something at a new prison for naughty young girls. No walls, but humane treatment -- that sort of thing. The fly in the ointment is the headmistress or foreman or whatever she is, the top sergeant, who runs the place on a day-to-day basis. And what an old-fashioned meanie she is, groomed like Mrs. Danvers or maybe the wife in \"American Gothic\".<br /><br />This movie was one of a spate that came out in the post-war years dealing with one or another social problem, often, as here, penology. Among the others were \"The Snake Pit,\" \"Sniper,\" \"Gentleman\\'s Agreement,\" \"Crossfire,\" others whose titles don\\'t come to mind at the moment. This is a lesser example of the genre, but not entirely without interest.<br /><br />What makes it interesting is that, though Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman\\'s husband in \"Casablanca\" seven years earlier, was by now over the hill and reduced to B pictures, the movie is full of those naughty young girls, including the 18-year-old Rita Moreno and the 19-year-old Ann Francis. They run around in their skivvies, get into fights, talk nasty, are cynical about everything, trying to run away -- in other words, these luscious young beauties are just begging to be spanked. That\\'s all they really need. They don\\'t need an understanding headmaster, just a couple of whacks. Oh, not savage whacks. Not at all. Rather, deeply caring whacks, whacks of love, so to speak, not enough to hurt but just enough to warm. Why didn\\'t Paul Henreid try that instead of this antiquated humanism? Huh? I\\'ll bet he WANTED to turn Ann Francis over his knee, that lanky and insinuating blond vixen, and teach her a lesson. You can see it in his face. The gentle smile can\\'t mask the lascivious grin of the maniac underneath. Come to think of it, if that didn\\'t work, why he could just have THEM spank HIM. They\\'d be learning a trade too -- professional dominatrix. <br /><br />Anyway, if he didn\\'t, he must be as crazy as the rest of this unimaginative movie. Some of the shots are striking; in others the lighting alone could have been handled by an alert ten-year-old kid. But why go on?<br /><br />This movie is \"reformist\" in the same way that Cecil B. DeMille\\'s early movies showed a lot of nudity, just to make sure we knew how sinful nudity was; or in the same way as one of those anti-war pictures that show us the brutality of combat before we inevitably win the battle. What hypocrisy.',\n",
              "  b\"Ninja The Protector is a watchable ninja flick. However, The Ninja Protector isn't a great ninja flick, its plot is just crappy. Let's begin with the fact that most of its ninjas are white, even though that some are Chinese. Its plot was a combination of exploitation, ninja action and a crappy drama, I know that it sounds cheesy and fun, but it's not that great. Actually, The Ninja Protector has boring scenes whereas the some of its fights save it. The ninjas are mostly white as I said above, but they have some interesting swords and daggers. Its plot is so awful that I won't even write about it, However, its soundtrack is actually cheesy and fun. Morever, its soundtrack is maybe the best part in this silly film, it is heard after and during the cheesy fights. In a nutshell, The Ninja Protector isn't very recommended, unless you really like ninja movies. 4/10\",\n",
              "  b\"Great directing, editing, photography and acting! It's difficult to make a movie about someone as well known as John Lennon and tell us something new, but the writer and his collaborators do just that. Phillip McQuillan is really exceptional, capturing the heady mix of hurt, anger and brilliance that John Lennon possessed. He has moments that are so right they're eerie. Christine Kavanagh, Blair Brown and Jamie Glover also shine. The mood of the early Beatles performances are captured perfectly by the hand-held camerawork and stylish, edgy cutting.\",\n",
              "  b'Given how corny these movies are, you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them. The movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there. The inhabitants were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), who gets haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter\\'s cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much into character.<br /><br />\"The House That Dripped Blood\" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from just being neat, there might be some undertones: it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs. assumed horror. Like in \"The Shining\", we might ask whether the house/hotel itself holds some memory of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul\\'s co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! Around the time that this came out, she also starred in \"Countess Dracula\" and \"The Vampire Lovers\" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will remain known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT SCREAM QUEEN! I\\'d like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-star in something.<br /><br />I guess that the only weird scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read that right. What kind of a name is \"Denholm\" anyway? Oh well. A very cool movie.',\n",
              "  b\"Long Time Dead opens to a caption that informs us that we're in 'Morocco 1979' where a group of people are holding a s\\xc3\\xa9ance which gets out of hand when a fire demon called a Djinn appears & supposedly kills everyone... Long Time Dead then cuts to present day London where four house-mates, Rob (Joe Absolom), Liam (Alex Newman), Webster (Lukas Haas) & Stella (Lara Belmont) are planning to go out for the night. They hook up with their soon to be new house-mate the drug dealing Joe (Mel Raido) & three friends, Lucy (Marsha Thomason), Spencer (James Hillier) & Liam's girlfriend Annie (Melanie Gutteridge). While sitting around at a club they begin to have a discussion on what the biggest buzz in life is, from this rather innocent sounding topic the subject of s\\xc3\\xa9ance's is brought up & for some reason they all decide to hold one. They find a suitable venue which appears to be in attic space above the club & begin, unfortunately they release the fire demon Djinn which spells the words 'ALL DIE' out on the Ouija board which freaks them all out, as it would I suppose. Shortly after Annie dies in an accident & her body has burns on it, the remaining member's of the group feel something is wrong & do some research which leads to some unexpected answers & the discovery that maybe not everyone is as they appear or who they claim. As more of the friends continue to die in accidents a way must be found to send the evil Djinn back before it completes it's mission to kill all those who summoned it...<br /><br />Directed Adam Marcus I thought that this English & French co-production was a somewhat modest & undemanding way to pass 90 odd minutes. The script by Eitan Arrusi, Chris Baker, Daniel Bronzite & Andy Day really isn't anything special & I can't quite believe it took four writers to come up with this. Generally speaking Long Time Dead is rather slow & uneventful & the characters are so bland & similar with most of them looking & sounding exactly the same & the only one's I could really distinguish between are Lucy because she's black & Joe because of his hair! Everyone else barely registered with me & that made it very hard to care about anyone or anything, oh & they're an unlikeable bunch of teenage stereotypes as well which didn't help the film. The script also features various lapses of logic, at the end I just couldn't stop thinking that it was a bit of a coincidence that a bunch of kids would just happen to hold a s\\xc3\\xa9ance & summon the exact same demon that their landlord & one of their Father's did years earlier, a fact which they only discover later on in the film. There is another scene in particular I keep thinking about that sums Long Time Dead & it's silly script up, when two people break into a police guarded house & turn the lights on only for the police officer on guard to be conveniently looking in the opposite direction & only looking back at the house literally seconds after the lights have been turned off. I also hated the scare tactic's that director Marcus employed, I mean people hearing noises only to have one of their 'friends' grab their shoulder & apologise for scaring them. What do these people think will happen exactly? Can't they just call out & say who it is that's creeping around in the shadows? Long Time Dead uses this clich\\xc3\\xa9d & lazy technique on a number of increasingly annoying occasions. There are also plenty of cheap demon point-of-view shots which presumably help save money by not having to show the demon itself. On the positive side it tells it's story well enough I suppose & while it's not exceptional Long Time Dead is a well made film generally speaking. I also liked the ending where the Djinn appears to win, it's nice not to have a happy sugar coated ending for a change. Long Time Dead is one of those horror films that has nothing really wrong with it & entertains to a certain extent but suffers by being just so average a few script problems that should have been ironed out especially since four people worked on the thing. The gore quotient is sadly lacking with nothing more graphic than a few splashes of blood & someone being burnt. As for the Djinn itself the best the filmmakers could come up with are some CGI demon eyes on an ordinary actor. There's no sex or nudity either but there is some swearing & drug usage which the film treats lightly & doesn't say is right but neither does it say it is wrong just that it's a normal teenage thing to do. Overall I thought Long Time Dead was a slightly below average horror that didn't do much for me but at the same time I have seen much worse & at least it kept me watching until the end. Don't spend any sort of money on it but if you can catch it on TV for free & there's nothing else on then it's probably just about worth an hour & a half of your time, but only just.\",\n",

              "  b'The greatest shortcoming of this series is perhaps the lack of an in-depth story and associated cinematics that were in the past, part and parcel of all Command and Conquer games. The interface is also annoying and very slow. The load times are pathetic even on faster computers. But the game itself is excellent and includes not two, but 3 sides. The levels are however, a tad repetitive and not very creative. There are plenty of units and associated gib effects to make up for that though. The America and China campaigns are too easy on normal skill and only during multiplayer is there a real challenge that will force you to think more strategically.

              "  b\"a horror film hasn't given me chills in a while. this film made me feel as isolated and terrified as the characters in the movie. I had seen the American re-make before this film, and i'm kind of glad I did, because I got to save the best for last. If you were disappointed by the American Pulse, this predecessor will certainly make up for that sorry excuse for a horror.<br /><br />I can say without a doubt this is one of my top films to watch alone in a dark room if I wanted to scare the hell out of myself. And that just puts a big grin on my face. Not to mention, the lighting and cinematography in this film is also really well done, and adds a lot to the completely creepy mood throughout. While the story may be hard to follow if you don't know the history behind the film beforehand, it's scary either way. I've watched it twice now, and it's just as good the second time around. Even though this film is considered an older J-horror film, it's still fresh in my book.<br /><br />I think horror film makers that rely on cheap thrills and gore should take Kairo for a spin, they'd learn a lot from it. Kairo is a truly haunting, scary film that will leave your eyes wide open in terror. 10/10\",\n",

Also on hand are Boone and Cronyn, but the entire cast is wasted in this nonsensical drama.

              "  b\"It is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations. Yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character, that it is, in my humble opinion, one of the very greatest films of all time.<br /><br />The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see Jacques Rivette's fantastic C\\xc3\\xa9line and Julie Go Boating, which was made around the same time). It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change.<br /><br />It involves a supposedly liberated m\\xc3\\xa9nage-\\xc3\\xa0-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). Yet Alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. The women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze.<br /><br />The film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the New Wave, having starred (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave, but he should be.<br /><br />There is no improvisation (unlike in John Cassavetes's similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film is resonant with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character Marie was based on, did too. The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by Veronika delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. This mesmerising, personal, and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around.\",\n",
              "  b'Since you can ask your friends\\' opinions and read reviews about mainstream films most anywhere, I try comment on the smaller, harder to find films which have little written about them (and the few comments you will find are usually cast and crew plugging the film). Hopefully I\\'ll help someone who is debating on whether the effort they might put into finding and seeing a smaller, hard to find film is really worth it.<br /><br />That said, \"Cyxork 7\" - a very high concept comedy - fails on every single level. I did not laugh once during the entire film, which is surprising especially since Greg Proops is involved. Dropping the f bomb for emphasis is not funny. Having running commentary in numerous points is not funny. Kicking someone in the balls is not funny unless the setup and payoff is good. For the entire film, the jokes have no setup and what\\'s more, the characters are not only flat and uninteresting, their motivations hardly make any sense.<br /><br />Like I said, the premise of the film had me interested, which is why I saw it at the Fine Arts Theater in Los Angeles. But the film seems to have an identity crisis of whether it wants to be drama or comedy.<br /><br />The editing was awful. The scenes drag far, far too long and instead of cutting on a joke or trimming needless scenes (maybe because there are a lot that don\\'t go anywhere), they linger. In particular I think of the scene between the 2 actors who have an affair on the side and the camera pans out for a few seconds then we cut. The actors all seemed uncomfortable with their lines.<br /><br />Ray Wise does a decent job and plays it straight, but the only problem is so does everyone else. This is a comedy, where things need to be over the top to emphasize the ridiculousness of the concept. Perhaps the best scene is that of the producer, which at least was colorful and he seemed like someone you could hate.<br /><br />That brings me to another point, there\\'s no sense of tone. The GNN news thing - is it supposed to be serious? Because the 2 anchors swear like sailors as though this were funny, and are very self aware of how cute they are being, which sucks you right out of the humor. (Now it would be much funnier if they played it straight but said absurd things). I mean, you have to ground this in some level of reality. Also, the text full of swears and innuendo was not funny but annoying, and simply repeating what the anchors already had said. Now if they had been established as an alternate news channel MAYBE I could buy it, but even so, it\\'s not so much the credibility as the fact the actors seem to giggle as though they think everything they say is hilarious.<br /><br />As for the plot, so many loose threads never come to fruition: the lesbian story between the news correspondent (why is she there again?) and the cam operator - I guess it\\'s funny because they\\'re lesbians? The nerd who is taping the behind the scenes footage and trying to direct his girlfriend act never makes sense - I thought maybe he would use the footage as blackmail, or to show he\\'s a better director, or perhaps he & everyone else who wants to direct would create a bunch of competing directors, but nope I was wrong, this goes nowhere and just seems like a lazy cutaway to bad quality video. The pregnant actor\\'s wife who held everyone hostage and then everything\\'s hunky dory? <br /><br />I understand this was low budget which is fine but it\\'s not funny. I actually would have been happier to see more physical comedy which would have lightened the tone instead of everyone being so serious. Oh yes, why would nobody on the crew leave instead of risk their lives? Do they want to break in that bad? (Again, lack of motivation here). <br /><br />The one saving grace was the idea of actors killing themselves to boost their careers. Could have been funny but then it becomes very dark and again the tone is awkward. Not to mention the final \"And she died by a cart\" post script at the end was out of place. <br /><br />Pretty much I was left scratching my head. So did they complete the movie or just the shot? What happens to the franchise? To the wife? To everyone else\\'s careers? But by that time, you\\'ll be walking out of the theater or turning off the film because the movie doesn\\'t seem to care and neither should you about seeing this film.<br /><br />VERDICT: STAY AWAY 2 out of 10 stars',\n",

              "  b'SERIES THREE- BLACKADDER THE THIRD \" If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before you start\" Hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the Prince Regent, a vain and stupid foil for Blackadders venom, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw. The format is similar to the previous show, after all now they had found the winning formula why change things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick an M.P.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically, the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a stellar cast',\n",
              "  b\"In 1600 the world population, for the first time in the history of mankind, reached 1 billion people. This doubled in 1860 to 2 billion people. Then in 1960 this doubled to 3 billion and then it accelerated to 4 billion in 1976. Right now we are heading towards 7 billion people and they all have to be fed, need schooling, want things we all want. I do like warning documentaries but they should tell the real problem and that is overpopulation. Of course politics won't burn their hands on this problem because of the powers of religions but the real problem are Too Many People, that is why the wild animals are leaving, dying out, there is not enough space. <br /><br />In this documentary, the same as Al Gore's, has many faults as global warming has nothing to do with mankind. Throughout the 4.5 billion years of history of the earth, climate has changed all the time. Greenland used to be green, pools have changed and Ice-times followed by warming up is part of the earth history. And we cannot stop this, we are living on a very violent planet, nothing is stable, earth quakes, volcanic eruptions, changing of magnetic fields, drifting of continental shells. Pollution is something we can stop, overpopulation we can stop. Climate change not. Of course with Global Warming scam, taxes can be raised without protest, trying to stop population grows is dangerous for politicians.\",\n",
              "  b\"Apparently this movie set out to make its viewers feel bad, and it certainly worked for me. This is one of the dullest scripts I have seen turned into movie lately. Having read sk4ek's comment on this, maybe it would be fair to add that it was made from a novel, and I watched the subtitled version (and I don't understand Japanese), so it seems I probably didn't get a lot of what made the novel good. Anyway, the script is all about what a gargantuan a**hole Kitano's character is, but whatever else happens just doesn't add much to the story. Just imagine the worst things a father could possibly do to his family, sequence them on a timeline, and you have the plot of this movie. But there simply is no character evolvement, no turning point, nothing that gives an interesting twist to things, they only keep getting worse.<br /><br />***mild spoiler below***<br /><br />Once I thought the story was going to take off, when another illegitimate son of A**hole Father moved in with the family, finally someone who had the potential to give a swerve to the plot line. After being defeated in a fistfight, he tells the boy who narrates the whole story to study hard, walks away and gets shot ten days later off screen. Segue boring story continued. The cinematography is alright, but not outstanding, and not enough to save this movie.\",\n",

              "  b'During the past six months or so, I have intentionally sat and watched hordes of terrible movies, in search of the most entertainingly godawful ones I can. I\\'ve probably been through about 50 or so. Riding the Bus With My Sister? Seen it. Shatner? Tons. Rock \\'N Roll Nightmare? Hell yes. Haim? Feldman? Ferrigno? Medieval Harvey Keitel? All this and more. Perhaps that is the only reason I managed to endure all the way through Riders of the Storm. I\\'ve become inured to a certain amount of bad movie pain. But not this much. I\\'m only human. This is, no hyperbole, one of the absolute dumbest movies I\\'ve seen in twenty-six years of movie watching.<br /><br />My brain has been so thoroughly assaulted by stupidity over the last hour and a half that it can\\'t even collate exactly what happened. A million things are all going on at once, and not a damn one of them makes sense. There\\'s a plane, see? An old bomber flying across the U.S., and on it are seven, sometimes eight men, all but one of which have apparently not touched the ground in fifteen years. They\\'re outlaws with no support system. At all, near as I can tell. Perhaps their plane is powered by wishes and daydreams, because they certainly have no way of getting fuel. They fly around the country using the sparse equipment on board to basically create a television program, S&M TV, and then interrupt legitimate broadcasts with their pirate signal. The things they broadcast are not professional or smart or funny or pertinent or, really, interesting in any way, and after fifteen years of it they have a nation of fans. Naturally. Did I mention one of the guys has a jet pack and that another one of them performs in-flight engine repairs without a safety harness? There\\'s a third whose only job on board appears to be to do tai chi and sweat. You\\'ll never once see the pilot out of his seat. Well, he\\'s only been flying for fifteen years; another two or three and he\\'ll take a nap. They have no way of getting a steady stream of food, but don\\'t worry: the jetpacker (oh God) sometimes brings candy bars and whatnot stuffed in his jacket. This movie thinks you are dumb, dumb, dumb.<br /><br />Our heroes are trying to discredit Mrs. Westinghouse, a female presidential candidate. They\\'re disgruntled Vietnam veterans and she\\'s looking to beef up the military and, they\\'re guessing, go to war again. She\\'s utterly without charisma, couldn\\'t deliver a rousing speech if her life depended on it, doesn\\'t come off as intelligent, and looks kind of like someone\\'s homely grandma. Clearly, she must be stopped at any cost. Furthermore, she\\'s labeled at one point as \"mysterious,\" and the only way the character makes even a little sense is if she basically popped up out of nowhere recently--had no past *at all*--and somehow quickly became some party\\'s primary candidate. I\\'ll refrain from giving away what even the back of the VHS box can\\'t help but give away, but Westinghouse\\'s big secret is just another fragrant turd of stupid the movie lays down. It\\'ll be obvious from the word go anyway.<br /><br />Whenever I thought I could give up for a bit and mentally move past one lump of potent idiocy like a speed bump just so I could follow the movie, along came two more. At one point I literally sat staring slack-jawed at the screen for probably ten minutes because I just couldn\\'t deal with it. The movie tries to take swipes at religion, politics, country music, the military, aerobics workout videos, etc., etc., but it\\'s all so amateurish and painfully unfunny that it seems about on the level of a really bad public access show with a mysteriously large budget. It plays about like an eleven year old wrote a script and, through a series of farcical errors, it got produced and turned into a real movie with real money behind it.<br /><br />It\\'s got plenty of garish 80s style behind it--the fact that the director worked on music videos came as no surprise, nor did the fact that this was his first movie--but its substance is practically nil. The movie has no idea that\\'s the case, however. It seems at times to believe that it\\'s a satire, but it\\'s way too dim to be capable of meeting any satirical ambitions. On a second viewing it might be laughable, but there\\'s so much to deal with that the first time around was just a painful exercise in masochism. I\\'m not sure I\\'d even recommend it as an entertainingly bad movie. Useful as a trial of sorts, a challenge for you and your friends to get through, perhaps.',\n",

              "  b'\"Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie\" is a film that has to be seen to be disbelieved. The first film, 1995\\'s \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie\", brought the six butt-kicking teens from the Fox Kids series to the big screen for the first time. That movie was not all that bad. It had some decent special effects, a somewhat interesting bad guy (Ivan Ooze), and the six young actors who play the Power Rangers were fun to watch. Plus, that film had a bigger budget. But they went back to the cheapness of the TV show with \"Turbo\". The special effects, production design, and costumes are so cheap and cheesy that you wonder why 20th Century Fox gave the go-ahead to let these filmmakers (who are close to the TV show) make this film. Also, the script is much worse than it was in the first movie. Bulk and Skull have more screen time here. It has one of the least interesting villains of all time (actually, a villainess). It\\'s very, very, very, very, very, juvenile. And the Power Ranger actors look as if they want to escape this atrosity. So I have one question. Why did they release this movie to theaters? This should have been released straight to video. Or better yet, release it as a TV movie, were this series started in the first place. This movie was totally inappropriate for the big screen. <br /><br />* (out of four)',\n",

First the black guy gets chased up a tree and eaten. No one notices. Then the Mexican guy gets chomped on and dies in the basement. No one cares. Eventually, towards the end of the film, the Caucasian characters start to get it. The only way to tell the characters apart is from their differing degrees of loathsomeness. Oh, and one of them wears glasses.<br /><br />All these people do is stand around in their depressing adobe hut and drink and drink and drink and drink. Eventually they weld some barrels together to make a goofy-looking tank to evade The Killer Dogs With Bathmats On Them. It\\'s a trip of only a few yards, yet they have to stop to rest frequently.

              "  b'\"The Evening Star\" is one of those movies that you can watch many times. It contains more laughs then \"Terms of Endearment\" and also less depth. But if you watch this movie in the observation that it is solely entertainment, and not to be taken seriously, it\\'s a lot of fun.<br /><br />Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine- reprising her Oscar winning role) is now dealing with her three grown Grandchildren. One is a saint, Teddy, who is already married with child. Tommy, the \"problem child\" of the original film, is in prison. And Melanie (Juliette Lewis), the youngest, is struggling through college because she\\'s going through a rebellious phase and likes hanging out with her sleazy boyfriend, or mooching off Patsie (Miranda Richardson), the now very rich divorc\\xc3\\xa9e. There\\'s also the loyal housekeeper Rosie (Marion Ross), who despite always being on her duties and quick to have a sarcastic comeback, is falling in love with the next door neighbor Arthur (Ben Johnson- in his last screen performance).<br /><br />All of this is a little hokey, but the performances more then make up for it. When Aurora starts seeing a therapist (Bill Paxton) and then sleeping with him, people start whispering about her reputation. And when Melanie keeps going back and forth between her relationship, she finally finds peace with Aurora, who she at first despised.<br /><br />\"The Evening Star\" is by no means superior to \"Terms of Endearment\". That movie is a landmark in it\\'s own right. But it is more fun- in my opinion. MacLaine, in a funny performance, seems more lively and witty here then her original time around. And the most fun of all is to watch her and Miranda Richardson go at it - almost like \"Grumpy Old Men\"- but FUNNIER. A scene in an airplane perfectly displays their hatred for one another- but in a way, they are best friends- since they\\'re always around each other, competing, gossiping or nagging.<br /><br />To wrap it up, it\\'s a long movie with a lot of unnecessary subplots (the death toll was ridiculous), but keep in mind this is also based on the book, so do we blame the filmmakers or the author? \"The Evening Star\" is a movie that should be watched for a good laugh. You don\\'t have to have seen the first one to understand it. True, Debra Winger is missing (but if you saw the first film you\\'d know why), but I am rating this solely on how well it entertained me.',\n",
              "  b\"So yes this is a nice harem Anime, oh wait, this is supposed to be a horror? You sure could have fooled me. In terms of horror and suspense Higurashi is a complete and utter failure. Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on 100% excess and shock-factoring.<br /><br />Higurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In 1983 a young male transfer student comes to a small town. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something.<br /><br />As wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a filler arc when something finally happens after 6 episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next, until something may just happen only for it to be a classic and clich\\xc3\\xa9d horror blunder trick. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it. So yes this series seriously lack suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller.<br /><br />Until some annoying detective constantly shows up to go over the SAME mystery we heard 5 episodes ago! The series can work up it's suspense and chill level, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not? Sure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again. But there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it.<br /><br />I can't express how dull of a horror this really was. Die hard horror lovers may want to stick to Elfen Lied, as for general suspense lovers (Like me) you may want to avoid this one. Apparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.\",\n",

The film explores the conflicts between his day-to-day job, his problems with his randy father who eventually gets himself in too deep with the much bigger and more brutal gangsters, his business partners, and the young Chinese woman he eventually finds to teach him to play the piano on a level that can get him an audition for his dead mother\\'s former manager.<br /><br />It\\'s based on James\\' Toback\\'s 27-year-old American film \"Fingers\" which starred Harvey Keitel and which is much admired; I haven\\'t seen the original but its hard to believe that Keitel was any better in the central role than Romain Duris (a look-alike for a young Daniel Day-Lewis for all you Brit-fanciers out there), who offers brutality, insensitivity and arrogance in most of his daily life, but with an undercurrent of melancholy and self-doubt that makes him one of the most real characters I\\'ve seen on screen in a while. I loved the look of the film; it\\'s shot in Paris but you\\'d never know, it\\'s all close-ups, cramped apartment spaces and dirty night-time streets, no scenery but the emotions on the expressive face of Duris and a few of the other characters.<br /><br />The film doesn\\'t talk down to the audience, something I find very refreshing after a summer of blockbusters...the first few minutes are a bit chaotic and confusing and they mirror the troubled protagonist. I love that, though he seems at times to be making progress out of his unpleasant and violent existence, you\\'re never quite sure...until the spectacular ending, where everything wraps up beautifully...or does it?

Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself . These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause \\xc2\\x96 to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Excellent script.<br /><br />Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is superb and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.\",\n",

When I finally saw this movie I was this disappointed for many reasons. <br /><br />001. It offers very little background on Leatherface and The Beginning shows him to be a ruthless killer. Yet in TCM (remake) he has feelings. This movie made him be a monster like Freddy and Jason.<br /><br />002. Who in the hell cast Jordana Brewster? This woman does nothing in this film except run and whine. I\\'m glad she was killed off. Sorry, Jordana but TCM just wasn\\'t for you.<br /><br />003. Why does Hollywood always want to kill everybody? Sure it was great for the first few remakes but in every movie you lead the audience to believe someone will actually survive and you kill them off like 10 seconds before the credits? Get some new material!<br /><br />004. One good thing about the movie is how the Sheriff came to be. He kills a cop then passes off a masquerade of being one. He\\'s even more evil and bigamist than the first. The whole soldier/marine torture was just brilliant and the bubble wrap almost death was alright. It had me going!<br /><br />Things that made no sense:<br /><br />001. The biker chick. What a waste! She makes the survivors crash into a cow on the road; planning to rob them and the damn woman gets shot by the Sheriff. Dumb! Thanks Sheriff! <br /><br />002. The hook impaled in the woman was too gory. Why? <br /><br />003. The fat lady that says \"Oh my, my, my\". It was hilarious when they shoved her against the door. She must weigh 500+ pounds. <br /><br />004. The birth scene should have had more details and more background on Leatherface. <br /><br />005. Leatherface\\'s personality in this film. No more sensitivity. Just steel heart!<br /><br />Throughout, the movie provided a few good scares. Too much hyped scenes and the ending was just dumb. Why make a movie if you plan to kill everybody? You could\\'ve let Jordana survive like Jessica Biel in TCM and Burns in TCM The Original. Hollywood needs to reconsider what they plan to produce and remake.

Drags on for about twenty minutes, and then the most incredible crew of drag queens, led by a terrible looking, punky Cheryl Ladd, invade the film with a coterie of the worst (somewhat) live actors, mechanical men and make up jobs the world has ever seen. Dialog is so horrible, that you literally cringe waiting for the next line. I literally became sick and had to turn it off because of the bad acting. Now I realize, none of us is getting younger, but what\\'s the thing with Kristofferson\\'s eyebrows? His acting is particularly wooden in this role, but Cheryl Ladd - good god, her performance (a la Pussy Galore in the film Goldfinger) would have stopped any other career cold. Strangely, the sets held up fairly well; the steaming turbines; the weirdly flat body bags, and so forth. But the cheap looking device that Cheryl and her tough pals are looking for - a device that supposed to turn this \"time travel\" joke of a story around - looks like a reject from a grade Z movie.<br /><br />It\\'s really like two movies in one, or one inside the other. Whatever. Watch for both of these film and avoid it.',\n",
              "  b'About the only accurate thing in the movie is the title. Yes, it does feature an F-117 Nighthawk. Well, sort of. Anything other than close-ups of the actors is either stock footage from other movies or government films. Virtually all of the F-117 is identical to what you\\'d see on a History Channel special (any of which, by the way, is more worthwhile to watch than this). One of the most laughable scenes is the one in which the Good-Guy-Hero-Extrodinaire flies virtually every variation of the F-16! First, he climbs into the cockpit of an F-15. As he takes off (without removing the wheel chocks, of course!) its your generic F-16. But...my God! By mid-flight, its been magically transformed into a two-seater F-16B trainer! But wait! Now the gray F-16 has altered its paint scheme to become a bluish tiger-stripped Red Flag adversarial training jet!<br /><br />So many other screw ups and laugh-out-louds that others pointed out, like the Presidential Motorcade consisting of his limo and one other sedan (whatever) as well as the \"War Room\" consisting of 9 chairs, a table, and a 20\" Sony.<br /><br />As far as the actors go, Ice-T has moved on to bigger and better things, like Law & Order: SVU (an excellent franchise to be a part of).<br /><br />1/2 out of ***** for plot, storyline, accuracy, and everything else important in a movie.<br /><br />****1/2 out of ***** for camp value.',\n",
              "  b\"I had seen the first movie some months ago and loved it, so when I saw the sequel came out, I couldn't wait to see it! Unfortunately, not only have most of the actors and actresses changed (Luke Malby is the only one who remains and is the only positive thing of the whole movie) but they have such little chemistry among each other that I almost felt ashamed watching. Between Luke and Kam the attempt to convince us they were the Edward and Paige from before felt so forced that I just kept asking myself all through the movie why did they change Julia Stilles, who had done such a great job. The producers obviously made more money than they thought with the first movie, and decided to make a second but came out with such a lousy result, that I think its a pity now that my image of the first movie is seconded with this sequel one! So if you loved the first, resist the temptation to spoil your memory with this second one!\",\n",
              "  b'I really enjoyed this movie. It should be noted that I have a high tolerance for low-budget fare. I got this as part of a 2-disc set, which I bought primarily to get a hold of Wolstencroft\\'s first feature, \"Bloodlust\". I finally watched this, and was pleasantly surprised. This is the tale of Daniel, a killer-for-profit(be it assassinations or murder and the subsequent sale of cadavers). Between bouts of drugs, partner-swapping, S&M and crime, Daniel ruminates on the nature of fascism. I don\\'t want to give away too much, but suffice to say that this movie doesn\\'t take the tried and true(not to mention clich\\xc3\\xa9) Hollywood approach of force feeding its audience an affable, cuddly lead character. Daniel\\'s opinions may shock and offend you. The movie\\'s morality is ambiguous and its philosophy unique. If you need a likable, handsome Tom Cruise type \"Hit Man\" in order to digest a movie, don\\'t watch this. If you are not afraid to have your own notions of film and character challenged, this movie should be an unexpected treat. The film\\'s budget and non-professional cast are evident. However, if this movie had been produced at greater cost, and with a well-known actor or two, it would most likely have been successful AND controversial.',\n",

Deveraux (Groucho Marx) is tired of dragging down the career of his fianc\\xc3\\xa9e, Carmen Novarro (Carmen Miranda), as the untalented half of their nightclub act and quits to become her agent. His powers of persuasion soon get the Brazilian singer a job as a featured performer at the Copacabana - twice over. She is forced to do double duty as herself and as Mlle. Fifi, a veil-covered Parisian chanteuse. The owner of the Copacabana, Steve Hunt (Steve Cochran), insists on romancing Mlle. Fifi, much to the frustration of Deveraux, who has already staked his claim to Carmen. Also frustrated is Anne Stuart (Gloria Jean), Steve's dutiful secretary, who is secretly in love with her boss. Another Copacabana singer, Andy Russell (himself), plays Cupid.<br /><br />An irritatingly stupid script, poor production values and almost no good lines for Groucho spoil this slight musical comedy. Andy Russell, who can sing but can't act, cancels himself out. Carmen Miranda fans may want to skip over everything except her numbers, which are good. Groucho fans may want to skip this altogether, unless they want to laugh at the awfulness of it all and imagine the sarcastic quipster delivering a scathing commentary track.\",\n",

The sex trade can stupefy and titillate with a thin line separating pleasure from pain. It is a means of gaining independence, but at the same time put a high price on the cost of human self worth. Denise Richards is cast as student working on an anthropology PH.D. and considering prostitution as a way to pay the bills; being a virgin proves to get in the way.

              "  b\"The Vanishing is a movie only those with ice in their veins can ever forget. The direction is absolutely brilliant, from the opening frames until the very end. I felt Saskia's fright when she thought she lost Rex initially, and her description of her dream made me feel chills. When she disappeared, Rex's combination of rage, frustration, anxiety, and grief was torture to watch. A particularly powerful moment was when he slammed the car door shut so hard the window crumbled into pieces.<br /><br />Watching Rex become consumed in every way by his quest to find Saskia was also extremely difficult to watch, although it was certainly inevitable. I found the professor's description of his actions appalling in many cases, the most notable one being when he fixates on Saskia and we see his POV. Seeing Saskia warmly respond to him was devastating, knowing what would happen. Throughout the film there was an overwhelming sense of doom and isolation, like this was a cruel world where even in the most idyllic settings evil lurked everywhere and attempting to fight it was futile. Rex undergoes one of the most harrowing emotional ordeals of any movie character ever, and when he is at the end of his rope his crucial decision would seem so insane out of context but viewers understand that it really is his only choice. The shock ending, especially the way it was done, almost made me scream, and I will never forget the final shot. The Vanishing could be shown in any film class on direction, as an example of perfection. Material that could have been turned into just a mediocre thriller with would have seemed like a lame twist was turned by George Sluizer into an utterly harrowing filmgoing experience. And that is the right word, because a movie like The Vanishing is not just watched-it is experienced.<br /><br />I estimate I have seen around 700 movies in my life, and horror is my favorite genre. I have only seen two films that left me so scared that after they ended I couldn't even move. One was Psycho, which I saw 10 years ago when I was only 12. The other one was just this year-The Vanishing.\",\n",
              "  b\"I once showed Chuck Jones's 'Cheese Chasers' to my best friend Amy, who remarked that it was the strangest cartoon she'd ever seen! Part of the masterful but lesser known Hubie and Bertie series, which more often than not tackled darker subjects than most cartoons, 'Cheese Chasers' takes suicide and mental illness as its subject and runs with its unique premise to create an exceptional and exceptionally black film. Having eaten more cheese than they can stand in the space of one night, the mice Hubie and Bertie decide there is nothing left to live for and therefore they should commit suicide. This one little event throws off the natural order in the animal kingdom to the extent that a cat and a dog also long for death by the cartoons end. Subverting the usual chase formula so that each character runs away from the character they would usually be trying to catch, 'Cheese Chasers' is a unique and absolutely wonderful cartoon. Just witnessing how disturbed each animal is by the twisted turn of events is enough to equally disturb the viewer while also provoking plenty of laughter. 'Cheese Chasers' is a highlight in the too often overlooked Hubie and Bertie series, perhaps only topped by the even blacker 'The Hypo-chondri-cat'.\",\n",
              "  b'Walt Disney\\'s \"The Rookie\" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35.<br /><br />The film opens with a brief synopsis of Morris\\' childhood, which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man. And even when his family settled for good in football crazed Texas, Morris\\' passion for baseball remained strong.<br /><br />The childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn\\'t work out.<br /><br />Morris\\'s team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams. They turn the table on him, telling him that he should try out for a Major League team. At several times when he pitches to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws. Morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district, he will try out for a Major League team.<br /><br />Big Lake does win district and, adhering to his end of the deal, Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays try out. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another try out with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays.<br /><br />This leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his Major League dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home. And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children.<br /><br />Morris signs with the Devil Rays, begins at the AA level and moves up quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season winds down, the chances of him getting \"called up\" grow increasingly slim.<br /><br />For the most part, I love this movie. There are lots of great performances and likable characters and it\\'s easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris. Also, the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels. And most of all, it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Still, the movie has some flaws. While generally accurate, it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores Morris\\' Christian faith. But considering Disney\\'s left wing zeal, that\\'s not surprising.<br /><br />Presumably, a lot of the exaggerations/fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic. Yet the 20 minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie.<br /><br />For example, from birth until his family settled in Texas for good when he was 12, Morris re-located 14 times. And his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left (pitching) shoulder, thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable.<br /><br />To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it\\'s good to not only watch \"The Rookie\" but to watch the DVD\\'s documentary, check out the aforementioned link to the movie\\'s inaccuracies and probably also to read Morris\\' biography, also titled \"The Rookie.\" I haven\\'t read the book but I hope to one of these days.<br /><br />But overall, \"The Rookie\" is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10',\n",
              "  b'This is a feeble and desperate attempt to tap into what is left of the underground comic book audience. Film makers have made other attempts like this and they always seem to go wrong. \"Fritz the Cat\", \"Heavy Metal\" ... they just don\\'t seem to work. But this is hardly even an honest attempt. It is a dodge that claims to succeed if they just get your attention. They got mine, don\\'t let them get yours.',\n",
              "  b'There was some decent photography and camera work. Robert Ryan should have played Custer, at least he didn\\'t have an Irish accent. However the plot, directing and waste of Cinerama film was almost as bad as the History. Why doesn\\'t someone make an accurate movie about Custer? He really is a fascinating study. He really was a \"boy \"General\" in the Civil War and even though most West Point Grads who were like Custer, in the right place at the right time for promotions; his rise in rank was phenomenal.<br /><br />Custer was an American hero of the time who went bust, but only a few people realize it at this late date. I live near the graves of several Confederate Soldiers who surrendered and should have been treated as POW\\'s. Custer had them hung. Lucky for him that he was on the winning side, and he didn\\'t have reporters running around with cameras.<br /><br />All this may not have much to do with the movie, but since the producers didn\\'t have the guts to put a disclaimer on their film that any any resemblance to real characters is strictly accidental, I will continue to describe some of the errors of the film itself.<br /><br />The Civil War battle scenes were obviously not filmed in locations close to resembling Northern Virgina. I believe General Phil Sheridan had one arm, and he was a real General who saved the Union from disaster in the Shenadoah Valley. His character as played in the movie is not accurate. Custer, like most officers who remained in the service after the Civil War, was reduced in rank. He was a Lt. Colonel when he died, although I looked hard to see his rank, and couldn\\'t see it. I was in the military and in combat, and rank is nearly always prominently displayed. I also know that enlisted men never eat steak for breakfast, as portrayed in the film. They were lucky if they got more than biscuits and coffee.<br /><br />Custer was the head of a regiment of cavalry. I have seen some pictures of cannons being hauled around in the west, but generally, the cavalry means mounted men on horses, not infantry or artillery.<br /><br />While in duty in the West, Custer was convicted of 7 offenses in a military court and his fine was loss of a year\\'s pay. Sheridan did get him off the hook. The film attempts to portray Washington as the primary villain, but in reality, it was finding gold in the Black Hills that lead to the end of the Indians rights to the Black Hills. Whether Custer, or others looked the other way defending the Native American\\'s rights was moot. A nation that had just fought a major conflict and still had weapons and trained soldiers was simply a fact of life. What was really tragic about Custer and the real inaccuracy of the film, is that Custer\\'s political ambitions are not shown. That is the theory of most historians as to why he lead his troops into such a disastrous military situation. He knew that the total might of western troops could easily defeat the hostiles, but if he won a major victory with a small army, he would achieve immense fame. The one tell tale sign that the writers of this film were on to the real Custer is when he said that Juan Pizzaro conquered the Inca Civilization with less than 200 men. Custer was responsible for the safety of his men. He sacrificed them to gain that same immortality. Wouldn\\'t this story be better than wasting Robert Shaw\\'s talents?',\n",
              "  b'Read the book! It is so much better. The movie does not even begin to reflect the complexities that Christie contained in her novel. Not to mention, HUGE plot twists are treated in a mundane way and many events are altered, discarded, or invented. Also, the character development in the movie lacks what the novel can provide. In a word, it SUCKS! While I realize that this is a movie website, if you are going to make a movie based on a mystery novel, you should probably at least attempt to maintain the integrity of the original work. Otherwise, just rob the general theme, give the people new names, and pass it off as your own.

Also the movie has a good southern Gothic feel to it. The movie though was mediocre but watchable. Glynnis O'Connor and Robby Benson (excellent chemistry in this and Jeremy(a better movie) make this a worthwhile effort. I have something to say about the comments of the boy being raped in the movie. It was rape. Even if it was consensual (which the boy thought it was) the boy was under 18. That is statutory rape. Even if he had tendencies or was gay or bi, that older man was taking advantage of him, a minor.\",\n",
              "  b'Bruce Lee stars as Billy Lo, an action star (of the martial arts variety) who mobsters are trying to force to sign with them, however after taking a couple of beatings and an assassination attempt, Lo fakes his death, has reconstructive surgery and looks to teach the mobsters what the meaning of \"No\" is. Game Of Death is Bruce Lee\\'s worst movie. This is an obvious truth. In terms of quality Game Of Death is sometimes even lower than Bruce Le or Bruce Li\\'s movies. The sequence where Bruce Lee\\'s face is pasted over the mirror (As others have mentioned) is truly as shoddy as it gets and overall the movie has a few alright action sequences in the beginning but it\\'s all very sub-par stuff. That is until Bruce Lee takes on Danny Inasanto and Kareem Abdoul Jabbar and of course which boosts its rating into low mediocrity. Also of notice (Though it\\'s all blatantly obvious even to those who have never seen a Bruce Lee movie) is the use of a stand in, in which the stand in wears sunglasses, bandage over his face, an old man\\'s costume and of course a hilariously bad fake beard. All of this is laced with Bruce Lee footage from his earlier movies. Usually to a closeup of Lee stock footage then followed by the stunt double\\'s back. In other words this is a very badly made movie but what makes it worth watching at least on a genre level is the climax which is awesome in its crispness and pace. In fact the only thing that leaves an impression on one after watching this, is how much better Lee\\'s original version would\\'ve easily been had he lived to complete it because as we know Robert Clouse added 90% new footage and made it into what we got here. Still worth a look for die hard fans (Like me) who will watch anything with Bruce Lee. Because of the awesome climax Game Of Death earns mediocrity the same way an A+ on a test would bring a grade of a D+ up to a C-.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)',\n",

Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. It's also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.\",\n",

Perfect entertainment for the Midnite Movie crowd, but could be offensive to women and of a moral authority.

Granted not all marriages are carbon copies of the ones on the show, but at least it hits on ones that are familiar. I found that the awkward moments with Mickey (Mike Binder) and his wife (Sonya Walger) looked like bad acting seemed to emphasize that awkward feelings they were having. Little nuances like this made it a little better for me. And the support characters are real to me. Especially since I have been on both sides (being the single guy and the married guy *sort of) The complaints seem real and the responses genuine as far as I could tell. I have since watched it and still find the humor. I was more curious about how long the show would last since they covered the main question of infidelity? The second season I am sure covered another topic, but I don't really remember. I do hope they put out the second season just so I can complete my thoughts on the show.

              "  b\"It aired on TV yesterday, so I decided to check it out. This was one of the last Bruce Timm/Paul Dini DTV projects related to their old 1992 Batman the Animated Series, after that Jeff Matsuda came along and re-imagined Batman with his new The Batman series, but anyway, the story of this new Batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as Batwoman, however Batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods, and also in the meantime take down The Pengiun and Ruphert Thorn who both are secretly working with Carlton Duquesne(who's having family troubles) and another villain(which is later revealed in the movie) on a weapons smuggling operation,they also put a bounty on the Batwoman. The question is: who is this mysterious Batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one? It's up to Batman to solve this mystery and stop Penguin's latest operation. For an animated movie, it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone, which is good. Another plus was the complete redesign of the Penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated Mob Boss we're used to seeing in the comics, unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from Tim Burton vision of Pengium(sewer rat and circus freak). Even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say, Batman Forever. The voice acting is standard quality for these direct-to-video projects(if only Batman: Mask of Phantasm took this route), Kevin Conroy still shines as Batman/Bruce Wayne. And like I said despite running for some very short 80 minutes, it manages to make a pretty good(and complex) storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action. There are a few downsides, however, Nightwing is nowhere to be seen, and I'm sure Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne don't click as a couple, even though is just referenced, Tim Drake(aka Robin) does very little in the movie and to be quite frank, I was never a big fan of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Batman character design(especially in their Batman shows post-BTAS), this The New Adventures of Batman and Robin, well, it kinda makes Batman look fat then rather a well-built bulked up individual(kinda like the Jeff Matsuda character model from The Batman). Bruce Wayne seems a bit awkward, those blue eyes make him look more like Clark Kent then Bruce(though it's true they do look very much alike). Another downside is Rupert Throne(no explanation as to why he is in this deal, but it's safe to say he's has goons and what's a cut of the deal) which does very little more then hang out with the Penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone(count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised. Overall, a good Batman animated movie, worth at least a rental.\",\n",

The saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage. It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full length film, covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $10,000 budget to complete it.

              "  b\"The Dentist is a really good thriller. And pretty disturbing. I think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters, vampires or zombies. That's exactly why this movie is so scary. During this film, you'll probably think about your own dentist a few times. Whether he's capable of doing such things...You better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him. That's what the story is all about. A respected dentist in LA snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool-boy. ( That must be the greatest profession in the world, by the way. Poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work) From then on our dentist, Dr. Feinstone, can only thing about taking revenge. He can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt. Things aren't made easier for our dentist when he's chased by an annoying tax-controller, a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his. At one point, Dr. Feinstone can't take it anymore. Now he's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him.. The dentist is written and directed by Brian Yuzna and co-written by Stuart Gordon. You can take that as a recommendation to itself. These 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies ( and personal favorites of mine ) like Re-Animator, From Beyond and Society. With the Dentist, they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller. This film came right on time actually. The decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far. I'm not at all saying this IS a masterpiece, but it's a nice change. Corbin Bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene. I remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor, but he can sure handle a psychotic character. The rest of the cast does good work too. The woman who plays Feinstone's wife is really attractive. Also, it was great to see Ken Foree acting again. The actor from my all time favorite movie Dawn of the Dead plays the cop in this film. Yuzna casted him in From Beyond too, 15 years ago and I thank him for that. I don't recommend this movie to everyone (if you have a weak stomach, I'll advise you to skip it) but if you do watch it, you'll enjoy it very much. You'll be disgusted...but that's an extra reason, I think. It's been a while since I was really freaked out by watching a film. It's a great topic to handle in the genre and Yuzna does it in a great way. Too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel. My humble opinion on the Dentist ... 8/10\",\n",

              "  b'Quite recently I watched a marvelous documentary on Australian exploitation cinema entitled \"Not Quite Hollywood: the True, Untold Story of Ozploitation\" \\xc2\\x96 which I highly recommend to anyone \\xc2\\x96 and it really stimulated me to track down a lot of titles I\\'ve never even heard about before. \"Snapshot\" is one of them; a peculiar psycho-thriller/melodrama hybrid that coincidentally came out shortly after the huge box office success of \"Halloween\" and thus had to be re-titled \"The Day After Halloween\" in order to make extra money and cash in on the success of John Carpenter\\'s classic. Obviously this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Halloween, Michael Myers or Haddonfield and hopefully not too many people will be beguiled by this cheap marketing scam. I\\'m not even too sure \"Snapshot\" fully qualifies as horror, since the film barely features any genuine moments of fright. Despite the still relatively low number of independent cult movies produced in Australia around that time, \"Snapshot\" is an adequate and professional accomplishment with proper production values, respectable performances and ambitious story contents. Heck, the film is so ambitious that the drama overrules and the thriller elements never really even come through. \"Snapshot\" is much more of a satiric portrait of the sleazy and dishonest advertising/modeling industry than it is a nail-biting suspense thriller. Director Simon Wincer (\"Harlequin\", \"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\") seemingly never ceases to enlarge the melodramatic universe surrounding the main character Angela, but actually there\\'s very few action. 19-year-old Angela is lurid into shooting a topless modeling ad by an eloquent and she promptly gets offered a job as the face of a perfume brand. Angela is very enthusiast and moves in with her photographer, especially since she\\'s tired of her domineering mother and dead-end job at the hair dresser salon. She rapidly adapts to her new classy life and doesn\\'t even have to bother anymore about her stalking ex-boyfriend and his (not-so) inconspicuous ice cream van. However, she learns this is predominantly a rotten world full of greed, betrayal, false promises, sexual harassment, blackmail and danger. As said, \"Snapshot\" is a plain straightforward coming-of-age drama falsely advertised as a genuine horror movie. There are two noteworthy sequences near the very end, but they hardly seem worth waiting for. This could be an interesting and compelling viewing experience, but then you better know beforehand to expect a serious-toned film instead of a brainless slasher imitation.',\n",

Naturally, the hippie school was the embodiment of everything good and wonderful while The Establishment (meaning; everyone and everything else) was shown as being corrupt, venal, sadistic, and without any positive qualities at all. There was absolutely NO attempt at subtlety or evenhandedness here, instead, this movie grabs you by the throat and shoves your face into its one-dimensional worldview.

I have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex, and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home.<br /><br />I am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and globalism's effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it). Rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox (not that there's anything wrong with that, other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras beads, how they are manufactured, by what people, and under what conditions, and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process. It openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, American importers, and finally, the consumer at the end of the chain.<br /><br />I felt a little sickened by this; equally by the Mardi Gras revelers, but also by the way the workers in China have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). The footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end, made a particular impression. But that was just my reaction; I can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently.<br /><br />Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this. This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume. If you have ever bought a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to think about.<br /><br />Outstanding and highly recommended. Need to see more documentaries like this.

Love it or hate it, this is a movie made for an audience of African descent with the intentions of bridging the gap between both sides of the Atlantic while simultaneously forcing African Americans to question their ways and identity. The perspective of the film maker can be questioned. One could complain that slave owners and Christianity was portrayed in too brutal of a light, as many of the other viewers have done. But must a film produced to explore the dehumanizing aspects of slavery along with the attempts by the slaves to reclaim their humanity also be one that reconciles the image of the enslavers? Of course not. This film was not published in a bubble. It is a part of a larger canon of slavery films, many of which have already highlighted the benevolence or at least mixed feelings of the master (see Roots, the Patriot by Mel Gibson, or even worse Jefferson in Paris).<br /><br />In all, this film was a brave attempt at complex and fairly unveiled aspects of slavery. It has its flaws but the biggest flaw is that many of these topics still go unrepresented on the big screen. Imagine how amazing a film of Nat Turner's Rebellion or the Hatian Revolt would be?\",\n",

This is the kind of movie you need to see on DVD so you can skip straight to the performances, because there\\'s really no other reason to watch this movie.<br /><br />I guarantee you won\\'t be able to get through this movie in one sitting. It\\'s basically garbage, and is interesting mainly as a historical curiosity.',\n",
              "  b\"This movie was a big disappointment. It went from having potential to becoming and absurd piece of Hollywood crap. The acting was mediocre at best (with the exception of Travolta)- I counted a half dozen times where Robin Wright's accent changed during the course of the film.<br /><br />What makes this movie so uncomfortable to watch is that all of the leads are considered fine actors, but they are hopelessly trapped in a boring, ridiculous, confounding movie.\",\n",
              "  b'Atlantis is probally the best Disney movie that i have seen in years. It has great action scene, magic, an intelligent and weel written script. Atlantis, brings back the magic of the Disney Classics such as \"The Lion King\" or \"Alladin\".

              "  b\"But you may easily be disappointed, if you see Jessica Lange's performance here, whom I had so much respect for (well, there are few moments when she actually is believable, but most of the time she's just too fake, would-be cool and high above), and even worse, Diane Keaton's pathetic and unbelievable acting. And she was so good in so many other movies, what a shame...<br /><br />What does make the movie worthwhile are the performances of a nasty Tess Harper and, before all, a wonderful Sissy Spacek. All in all, Lange, Keaton and Spacek don't deserve this film and it doesn't deserve them, nor can they save it. Oh yea, and the characters have rather stupid names and act in a too hysterical way. Though hardly enjoyable, Spacek and the better part of the story raise my personal rating to 4 out of 10.\",\n",
              "  b'The same difficulty I have with the musical version of \"Les Miserables\" applies equally to \"Oliver.\" Instead of the composers\\' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings, they merely wrote Broadway-type melodies, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed.<br /><br />Too, the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score. It\\'s a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.<br /><br />The casting of the boy Oliver doesn\\'t help matters: tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, there\\'s something less than solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes he\\'s obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.<br /><br />\"As Long As He Needs Me\" is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. The two big production numbers, \"Who Will Buy\" and \"Consider Yourself\" seem over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It\\'s one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess. <br /><br />The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess I have trouble with Mr. Dickens\\' consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /><br />Not all the combined talent of this production, either on- or behind camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material. All this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me.<br /><br />',\n",
              "  b\"Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...<br /><br />Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I'm not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.<br /><br />In a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.<br /><br />Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.\",\n",
              "  b'This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time. For one, it has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain, brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters. The plot, about mistaken identity, payroll robbery and murder, is as trite and perfunctory as you\\'d expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western, but Wayne\\'s strapping good looks, easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. Plump, balding Eddy Chandler isn\\'t quite believable as Wayne\\'s womanizing \"partner\", and there\\'s a running gag about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. On the other hand, Wayne\\'s love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman, the little \"Mary\" of the early \"Little Rascals\" fame. She is a grown-up 20-year-old now, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne\\'s leading ladies in these Lone Star/Monogram \"B\\'s\" were fairly bland and colorless, but Mary is perky, cute and, yes, sexy. There\\'s a scene in the general store, where she works, in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of \"nerve tonic\", which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. Wayne\\'s ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps, then again as she comes down, then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. Wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. Anyway, it\\'s an interesting little \"B\", not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The final gunfight isn\\'t handled all that well, and Chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while, but all in all, it\\'s worth a look, if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.',\n",

I thought Jon English turned in a superb performance as the Pirate King and the comic scenes were played for all they were worth without (mostly) becoming unfunny. Choregoraphy - especially with the police in the second act was first class. A couple of minor quibbles - not sure why it was necessary to bring in the trio from Ruddigore - it seems fashionable these days to \"cross-dress\" so to speak and although this actually worked quite well it wasn\\'t really necessary. The Swinglettes as a take off of the Andrews Sisters was superb but unfortunately it also meant that Edith was hardly distinguishable from the rest of the daughters when she has a decent part in the original score. Minor points, though, you could hear the audience absolutely loving it and it kept far enough on the traditional side of the line without being stuffy - Gilbert may have shuffled uncomfortably in his grave but he would not, I think, have turned right over.

              "  b\"Vampires Anonymous starts in Los Angeles where Vampire Vic Weller (Paul Popowich) needs help controlling his addiction to blood so he calls Vampires Anonymous who run a twelve step program for Vampires. A program designed to make Vampires not want to drink human blood & be there if they need help or are having trouble, the first step is apparently to 'admit you have a problem' & ends with 'smile, your a winner!' although there's lots of hard work & temptation to overcome between. Vic gets packed of to Rock Creek, North Carolina where he has to blend in with the locals & feed on the blood of sheep but Vic finds it hard to suppress the Vampire within himself...<br /><br />Co-written, co-produced & directed by Michael Keller I have to say right off the bat that I hated Vampires Anonymous., of course this is just my opinion & I'm in no way saying that you will definitely hate it but I think there's a fair chance the majority of potential viewers will find much more to hate in Vampires Anonymous than like. The script by Keller & J.P. Srinivasan is the biggest problem here, again this is just my opinion but I thought it was terrible. Vampires Anonymous is supposed to be some sort of light hearted comedy horror romance with a pinch of biting satire about therapy groups & psychiatric help thrown in there for good (bad?) measure. If that basic story outline makes you laugh then you may enjoy Vampires Anonymous but I thought it was an awful attempt at trying to be clever & funny & different, Vampires Anonymous is one of the most unfunny comedies I've ever seen & the makers can't even pull off a good sheep shagging farmer joke. The genre of horror comedy is very hard to pull off & the makers of this fail in spectacular fashion, the horror elements are none existent, the romance is so cheesy & predictable I almost threw up & it took me four sittings of twenty odd minutes each to get through this because I literally couldn't get through it one go.<br /><br />Director Keller turns in a competent film & that's the only reason this turd gets two stars out of ten rather than one. It's not scary, it's definitely not funny, there's no tension, it's utterly predictable, the story is all over the place, the character's are unlikable, the dialogue sucks & I found it a real chore to sit through. I didn't like it. At all. Forget about any gore, there's a couple of neck bitings & a bit of blood drinking otherwise nothing. No nudity either. According to the closing credits Vampires Anonymous was edited by the interesting named Farm Dog, either that it was was literally edited by a farm dog.<br /><br />Technically the film is fine & is really the only positive aspect of it but since it sucks so bad in every other way does it really matter? Shot in Burlington in North Carolina apparently, I doubt this is going to do much for the tourist numbers though. I have some advice for Michael Madsen, get a new agent considering some of the crap he's been in. I mean from the classy Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) to this as his next film?! Having said that the quotes 'I probably made a few pictures I shouldn't have done, but I have four sons and I have to pay the rent. If you have a decision to make about whether or not you can buy groceries at the market or whether or not you're going to make a bad movie, you're going to make a bad movie.' & 'My career has been very strange. My career is like a heart monitor. I get involved in a good project now and then to keep things going. And then I make things that I work on that I hope are going to be good so I can make a living and keep a roof over the heads of those little monsters I have in my house. You know, every movie you make can't be great, no matter who you are. Even Brando made some clinkers.' from his page on the IMDb explains why he makes rubbish like Vampires Anonymous. We all have to pay the rent I suppose.<br /><br />Vampires Anonymous sucks as much as the Vampires in the film, I'm sorry but I really disliked every aspect of the story & found it so unfunny & moronic it's untrue. If your looking for biting satire go elsewhere, if your looking for some laughs go elsewhere, if your looking for some horror go elsewhere & if your looking to be entertained go elsewhere.\",\n",
              "  b'I grew up a fan of The Three Stooges...basically thinking that there was \"no other comedy prior to 1960 besides them\". Since that time, I still believe the Stooges, especially Shemp-era material, is the greatest comedy of all time. In the 1990\\'s I came to appreciate the genius of Tim Moore & Spencer Williams. I have almost every episode of \"The Amos \\'n\\' Andy Show\" and now consider them just a hair below the Stooges in terms of comic creativity.<br /><br />Honesty needs to come into play here as I reveal that I had never seen a full W.C.

              "  b'Let\\'s see.... take one of the more infamous literary staples, namely the Gor books by John Norman, convert it to film and you\\'d think you\\'d be onto a winner. Why? Well, the Gor books, for those of you who haven\\'t had the pleasure, or pain, can be summed up as follows: Conan with pornography. Each and every novel was chock full of porn, sado-masochism and bondage. In short, a \"raging-hormone-male-teenager\\'s\" wet dream. Hidden amongst the sleaze and thinly-veiled attempts to make the reader think of women as nothing but objects, there are actually some pretty good action-adventure stories. So it would seem that converting them to celluloid would be a winner, even if only on the soft-porn circuit.<br /><br />Sadly, Outlaw of Gor is nothing like the books. Given my description above, some might breathe a sigh of relief at that. Unfortunately, by taking away the sex, having a budget less than that of the average teenager\\'s weekly pocket money and doing some awful re-inventing of the novels\\' original ideas (yes there were some!), the filmmakers literally killed the golden goose and replaced it with a prize turkey.<br /><br />Outlaw is just horrendous throughout, from the acting, the sets, the laughable \"costumes\", the editing and dialogue right down to the fight scenes that appeared to have been choreographed by the Marx Bros. But the worst thing is seeing how little they used the original material. Nevermind the porn, they plucked names out of the books and didn\\'t do a whole lot else. Tarl Cabot, the hero of the novels, is translated into a weedy vegetarian who is totally against slavery - a complete reversal from the novels. Likewise the Priest-Kings - In the books alien insectoids who ruled the planet. In the movie we get.....Jack Palance, who doesn\\'t seem to be in command of his own lines, let alone the planet. And yes, Jack leers and mugs his way throughout the movie, at least having the grace to look embarrassed at several points.<br /><br />The plot is feeble, centering around an evil Queen\\'s attempts to take control of the city of Koroba by murdering her husband and blaming it on Cabot. There then follows interminable amounts of wandering about in the desert by Cabot and his midget henchman (I kid you not!). We\\'re also treated to far too many shots of the midget\\'s rear end during the film (I mentioned the costumes were rubbish, didn\\'t I?) and awful moralising dialogue by Cabot about the evils of slavery.<br /><br />There are no special effects to speak of - the budget was too miniscule for that, just the heady excitement of one lame swordfight after another. At the end, which really sums up the whole movie and had me in hysterics, Tarl Cabot makes as if to snap his sword over his knee - a symbolic gesture of peace. Would have been good too, except that the sword does not break - it bends into a U shape like it was made out of thin tin. Yep, that\\'s Outlaw of Gor for ya - all bent out of shape.<br /><br />Even on MST3K this is one of the lamest excuses for a movie. It really is best avoided.',\n",

The main characters is totally uninteresting and is relatively indestructible, so there\\'s no reason to have any anticipation what-so-ever.<br /><br />The story is rather stupid as well, centering around the discovery of Noah\\'s Ark. Apart from that the movie involves many explosions, graphic deaths, and more explosions.<br /><br />What adds insult to injury is the animation. While rather good and relatively fluid, it shows that more money went into making a lousy movie look good than actually starting out with a decent movie in the first place. Polish a turd and it\\'s still a turd. Also, if you\\'re looking for something along the lines of Akira animation, look elsewhere as this movie has none of the style, daring use of lighting and color, or technique that Akira pioneered.<br /><br />Another rather bothersome element is the terrible voice acting done by the child in the movie. While original voice actors are always superior to a dubbed voice, I don\\'t see how a dubbed voice could sound more \"mechanical\" or \"forced\" than that child did.<br /><br />This movie appeals to the lowest common factor in people.

Now take a look at Bambi 2. A lot of unnecessary yapping in between cheesy pop songs. Some of cute moments, some jokes reused from the original, and the movie even has its fair share of toilet humor. The fawns are now rambunctious and argumentative, at points even fighting with each other.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying that Bambi 2 has to be a carbon copy of the original, but shouldn't it at least possess a similar tone? There were many things I did like about this movie- the animation was spectacular, and the movie was, overall, pretty sweet. The original movie had a style that's hard to emulate, I'll admit. And hey, toddlers will probably pay attention to this one much longer than the first.<br /><br />However, in history, there are some films that just shouldn't be touched. Cinderella? Aladdin? Okay.

The characters along the way are well acted - in particular the robot creator and his ditsy assistant. This movie is a tear jerker as Andrew's friends come and go and lifetimes pass him by without him really comprehending it all. The only real failings were the large gaps in time and how Andrew came about - but then it's difficult to compress 200 years into 1 1/2 hours.

I've seen a lot of films, and a lot of bad films, but nothing prepared me for this; by the end of it I was a gibbering, snivelling wreck, tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog, clawing at the walls, howling till my lungs were sore.

              "  b'I honestly feel that this is a great Godzilla film in many ways; but the negative comments written on reflection by some viewers are difficult to dismiss. Many of the negative reviews of \"G.: Final Wars\" reflect a frustration with that film\\'s radical revision of the very look and feel of the series. Here, the problem is that, despite innovations, \"G. 2000\" remains narratively and stylistically bound to the traditional series, but can\\'t quite deliver the goods some fans expected of it. This bodes ill for the whole \"millenium\" series that follows, and indicates why this Godzilla series, while developing a cult of its own, lost the interest of many older fans.<br /><br />I\\'ll approach this by remarking an important point that, oddly, many missed, reflected in the American audio commentary to the US DVD version of the film. What astounded me, right at the beginning of the film, was that the Americans involved in the loop and re-edit of the US release had not the slightest clue that a great deal of the humor of the film develops by spoofing the wretched American \"Godzilla\" (-in-name-only, or GINO) of 1998; The opening has Godzilla at a light-house, not only as a tribute to the granddaddy of post-WWII dinosaur flicks, \"Beast from 20,000 Fanthoms\", but because \"Beast is the film the American GINO was really remaking. This is quickly followed by a confrontation between our human protagonists and Godzilla in a roadway tunnel - clearly a comment, and spoof, on the tunnel sequence that ends the GINO film. Little digs at GINO pepper the whole film; and along with them, back-handed comments on the previous Godzilla series of the \\'80s and \\'90s.<br /><br />Visually, something odd is going on here, and I don\\'t mean the new Godzilla suit some have a difficulty with; actually, performed well and photographed from the right angles, it can be very impressive.<br /><br />What\\'s happening is in the background, but it shapes the whole look of the film. With the enormous development and reconstruction of Tokyo over the past few decades, the city has literally shot up, with enormous skyscrapers tossed together with every little over-all urban design. Let\\'s face it - these buildings very nearly dwarf Godzilla; although technically larger than ever before in the series, he looks smaller because of the urban growth he has to wade through. This also accounts for some of the higher-angled placements of the camera, which have the audience looking down on Godzilla (without the jet or helicopter POV as in previous films).<br /><br />The fact is, the world around Godzilla is becoming ever more complicated; the film-makers are pretty savvy about it, but many audiences, although more sophisticated about such matters than they were in the 1960s, clearly feel uncomfortable with even minor renovations in the series, since these frequently reduce Godzilla in stature, in comparison with the legendary city-stomper of old.<br /><br />As for me, I really like the characters; I find the special effects impressive and the story engaging. And from what I have in the American re-release, I think the film-makers did a pretty good job over-all.<br /><br />Maybe the reason Toho decided to retire the character is because they had to; maybe the era of Godzilla is over and it\\'s time to find new monsters and new heroes. Too bad; it was a pretty good era for vinyl puppet monsters and invasions from outer space. In that regard it was truly a fun ride, and if it is indeed over, I will miss the best of it.',\n",

The Agamemnon has been encoded by Goad to start on its preprogrammed destination once it is revived by a salvage team. J.T. Wayne (Sandra Bernhard) is the Captain of the Salbor, the salvage ship that undertakes said mission. Things go awry for the Captain however when a portion of her assembled crew lead by her former lover, a cutthroat type named Vendler, double-crosses her and looks to gain the valuable Solarium aboard the ship for himself. However he didn\\'t count on Goad\\'s reprogramming of the ship\\'s systems. Yet even in the face of defeat, Vendler refuses to give up his hold on the ship or listen to reason or logic. Now as the clock ticks down to a collision with the Earth, Wayne and her new crewman, a former bartender named Lennon (Cameron Dye), must try and find a means of stopping the Agamemnon or millions on Earth will die! <br /><br />Well I have to admit this is competently made. They keep the action moving nicely along and the visuals often prove distracting and interesting. The whole concept with Goad shows some level of originality and I enjoyed Laura San Giacomo\\'s performance as a crazed computer programming genius who has a God complex and an obsession with quoting Shakespeare. Where this falters is when our story changes its focus to J.T. Wayne, played by an horrifically miscast Sandra Bernhard who constantly uses the catchphrase \"And Don\\'t You Forget It!\" and basically goes all out to put off any male in the movie, including the man who is supposed to be her love interest. The failed attempts at humor in the film are far more likely to make viewers shake their heads in disbelief than cause them to laugh. In fact, this film frequently has this effect on any viewer who can manage to sit through the whole thing. To me, it is this element of \"I just cannot believe what I am watching\" that makes this so bad it\\'s almost good.',\n",

Of course Pesci was great - the woman in it, Marissa Tomei not only was quick, witty, gorgeous, but acted the part easily - and I think was the #1 actor in the movie.

I watch a load of independent movies, many with budgets much lower than this film had, and I have yet to see such a badly written, badly directed, badly made and woefully badly acted dud as this. The film is as unfocused as it is unbelievable and veers off on side plots that contribute nothing to the main storyline.<br /><br />And Justin Herwick is a good actor in the lead role? Please don\\'t make me laugh. Are you friends of his or something? His emotions do not change a single time throughout the entire film and he mumbles his way through all of his dialogue as if he could care less. I\\'ve never seen such an inept and lazy performance in my entire life and it\\'s one of the main things that completely ruin this film. It\\'s as if the actor thought he could cruise on his looks alone. Sad thing is, he isn\\'t all that in the first place and you have NO clue why everyone in this movie is in love with him. He\\'s not very bright, average looking, self-absorbed, incredibly boring and slutty; your typically dumb airhead club kid type. Yet everyone in this movie is falling all over him as if he\\'s either a drop dead gorgeous and/or fascinating person. Please!<br /><br />But of course there\\'s a heavy-handed moral to the story after most of the running time has been used up basically showing a bunch of guys parading around naked, useless subplots that exist basically to show even more nudity and people spitting out laughably angsty dialogue (a part where one character compares love to 9 miles of intestines in the human body is about the worst attempt at \"deep\" dialogue I\\'ve ever heard). The horribly conceived \"it\\'s time to grow up\" moment in question though is when Sam (Shane Powers), a friend of Jacksons, kills himself because he\\'s also secretly in love with him!

The subplot involving Marini\\'s gay brother\\'s desperation over unrequited love for an imprisoned stud (which is all magically settled by the end) is merely boring. Really, the only attention-grabbing element - apart from Marini herself, that is - is the score; the pet goats are cute, too.

Remember, it is science FICTION. Unresolved endings and dark story lines were the trademark of the first season while the second series succumbed to safer familiar territory. One can point to the unexplained changes in Season Two as show killers, but I think people who latched on to this simply wanted another \"Star Trek\" and were disappointed.<br /><br />I wasn\\'t disappointed ... I found the stories fresh, realistic, and full of literary references that fleshed out the scripts rather than purloined as borrowed lines uttered by the actors.<br /><br />The main idea built around the premise of the moon forcibly ejected from the earth\\'s orbit was a risky move, and I suppose many viewers thought this too ridiculous, therefore I wonder if an episode, a continuation of the pilot episode, that picks up the events befalling earth below simultaneously was in order. Perhaps that idea was kicked around but rejected because of similarities to Irwin Allen\\'s disaster flicks of the time, budget constraints, the lack of a script, or the fact that the series was about space, not earth.

Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. Lancaster over acts to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. It seems like the 1950\\'s was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. She just made a bad choice here.

The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze. Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humour and homilies from the heart.<br /><br />If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us \"Airplane\" and the \"Naked Gun\" series. This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since \"Bullitt\" and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can, but one must admit he\\'s perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.<br /><br />For those who haven\\'t noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics. This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. As usual, they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA.<br /><br />A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone\\'s rampaging pair of Cartmans.<br /><br />In summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the \"Naked Gun/Airplane\" formula.

It is amazing that such things still exist in today's world. This movie is a warning that there must be no more regimes such as the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Reading about how the film\\'s failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director\\'s subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore, I can see their point: I may prefer Fulci\\'s earlier \"giallo\" period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but, even on the latter, his commitment was arguably unquestionable. On the other hand, CONQUEST seems not to have inspired Fulci in the least \\xc2\\x96 seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist, sprinkle it with incongruent characters (cannibals vs. werewolves, anyone?), irrelevant gore (we are treated to a gratuitous, nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists!) and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked, brain-slurping villainess (don\\'t ask) and her slimy reptilian pet!! For what it is worth, we have two heroes for the price of one here: a young magic bow-carrying boy on some manhood-affirming odyssey (Andrea Occhipinti) and his rambling muscle-bound companion (Jorge Rivero i.e. Frenchy from Howard Hawks\\' RIO LOBO [1970]!) who, despite being called Mace (short for Maciste, perhaps?), seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 out of trouble (particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the \\'boils\\'). Unfortunately, even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti\\'s electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times. Fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness (after defeating one and all with the aid of the all-important magic bow\\xc2\\x85so much for his own supposed physical strength!) onto his next \\xc2\\x96 and thankfully unfilmed \\xc2\\x96 adventure!',\n",
              "  b'After reviewing some of the comments written by other contributors I felt I needed to clarify some issues raised.<br /><br />This was an independently produced film made with relatively unknown actors and a limited budget.<br /><br />That being said, the writing is a cut above most films put out to the public and the art direction (utilizing real apartments and settings) captures nicely the buffered world of New York City\\'s Upper East Side.<br /><br />The acting style though it may appear to be arch and affected actually captures quite well the voice patterns and intonations of those people it portrays.<br /><br />The film is truly a small gem. The audience gets a glimpse into the lives of a privileged set of college aged \"preppy\" Manhattan-ites. Lots of fun music helps keep the scenes jaunty and most of the actors are well cast.<br /><br />The film while intellectual in bent, plays most of the scenes decidedly tongue in cheek which keeps the movie from feeling pretentious.<br /><br />The movie is a baby Hannah and Her Sisters if you will. I also enjoyed the director/writer\\'s two other films to date, Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco.',\n",

To see her speak her lines, to hear the delicate phrasing of not only her Polish, but her German with a Polish accent, then later, her English with a Polish accent, an altogether brutally difficult accomplishment, leaves me breathless. Beyond that skill, there's her transference to the character, Sophie, and to the main test as an actress, the absorption of the unspeakable atmosphere of a place -- the camp at Auschwitz -- of wholesale pain, indescribable humiliation, and the final acceptance of death of her child to save another. I'm sure the author of the book wept too in seeing his creation come to life as Meryl Streep.\",\n",

              "  b\"HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER 2- MASK OF SANITY (2 outta 5 stars) Uh, long enough title, you think? First things first: this movie is one of those In Name Only sequels... and has practically nothing to do with the original classic. It hasn't got the same writer, director, actors or even the same style. This film is of a distinctly lesser quality in every respect. (This movie has some of the absolute WORST, fakest fight choreography I have ever seen!) Neil Giuntoli stands in this time for Michael Rooker (the original Henry) and, while he has a couple of effective scenes of underlying, stoic menace, for the most part he doesn't make much of an impression. This time around Henry is on his own and looking for work. He gets a job cleaning and moving port-a-potties and makes fast friends with a co-worker, Kai (Rich Komenich). Kai and his very un-happy-looking but smolderingly sensuous wife (Kate Walsh) invite Henry to stay with them until he gets some money put together. They also have an emotionally unstable niece (Carri Levinson) who draws freaky pictures. You think, with the two women in the house making googly eyes at Henry and carrying all that emotional baggage, that the tension would escalate into something really interesting. Well, you'd be wrong. Instead, Henry finds out that Kai does arson jobs for extra cash and the two of them get sidetracked into burning down old buildings for awhile. Then Henry starts into his killing spree again, slowly involving Kai more and more. The finale is a big disappointment in all respects... hardly touching on some of the more interesting elements introduced earlier in the movie. No wonder that there hasn't been a Henry 3.\",\n",

              "  b'I\\'ve never written an IMDb review before, but at the insistence of director John Stimpson I will tell the world my feelings.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Stimpson\\'s lack of choices make for a confused genre film that doesn\\'t know if it wants to be a murder mystery, ghost story or horror film. Combining these three fields weigh the film down causing it to stumble over its own shoddy progression.<br /><br />The acting is undeniably sophomoric even from the veterans that populate the screen. They careen through the film as if making a TV movie of the week. The frequent chuckles I heard from the surrounding audience makes me feel as if I\\'m not alone in my thinking. There is way to much running through the woods screaming. At one point I was hoping Robert Stack would emerge and ask for any information to the where-abouts of Lucy Keyes.<br /><br />The direction is stilted and stiff. The use of hand held is meant to loosen up and flow with the characters, but feels instead like a contrived way of convincing the audience that the film is tense. Stimpson\\'s film feels like oh so many movies I\\'ve watched by 15 year-olds, self- important and lackluster. <br /><br />The script is amateur in every way; from the Cray paper thin plot to the use of swear words. Robert Towne spoke of his film the Last Detail\\'s use of vulgarity as a substitute for action. Here, Lucy Keyes uses swearing as a substitute for naturalism. Stimpson believes that if the parents cut loose and let an F-Bomb fly they\\'ll be more human and believable. Instead, each curse reminds me that I\\'m watching the most pedestrian of film-making.<br /><br />As something that wants to be a ghost story, horror film and murder mystery the film lacks any scares other than cheap \"jump\" scares. The lack of atmosphere in the supposed tense portions of the film makes for a laughable movie. It also diffuses the overall tone making the film feel muddled and unfocused. How anyone could find this film scary is beyond my understanding. The Nickelodeon television series Are You Afraid of The Dark is much scarier and has no use for severed pigs heads.<br /><br />Technically the film is just above competent. The photography is nothing special, I believe this is because Stimpson made no choices in preproduction so as to color correct it later. This leaves the photographic images flat and undynamic. Nighttime is blue, daytime warm. The editing is uninspired. Its mostly an offender of the editor\\'s \"band-aid\" using dissolves and fades to black in an over abundance. The crude use of these fades to black feels more like an area for a commercial break, unfortunately none came. I could\\'ve used even the most terrible of commercials to break my boredom with this film.<br /><br />What does one do with a film like this? Television? I wouldn\\'t force this on even the most unassuming Lifetime Television watcher. The castration of dignity Lifetime would do to a film like this may be fitting, but even that audience would be pained watching this film. DVD? Maybe, but what\\'s the point? Lucy Keyes should prepare for a long shelf life.',\n",

              "  b'Imagine the perfectionist forms Kurosawa had achieved with samurai epics, Ford and Lean with lyrical, volatile nature, Tarkosvky and Bresson with the spiritual-bound outer space or dinky office desks of priests and cops, then add a too-generous wallop of Clouzot\\'s suffocating suspense flooding from the dark recess of human nature - and King Hu\\'s universe of the Wuxia STILL has plenty of its own identity left! This is truly groundbreaking in every way, in context of envisioning the worlds of Jiang Hu, civilian life, elite politics, and spiritual dissidents.<br /><br />A previous comment noted \"A Touch of Zen\" as a \"minor masterpiece\" next to its Japanese contemporaries, which is as ethnocentric as saying Asian films deserves such broad-sweeping generalization DESPITE their completely different context of cosmology, specific relations and development of individual and social structure, etc., even given the surface similarities of skin color, religious practice, select cultural affinity, and more. <br /><br />(For example, what\\'s the value in judging Billy Wilder\\'s best _at the expense of_ those by Ernst Lubitsch, or vice versa, simply because both had Germanic backgrounds and exiled to America and excelled at witty romantic comedy? They operated in rather different production settings, cultural milieu, sources of inspiration, etc.)<br /><br />Back to \"Zen\". Forget all the hierarchies of Taoism, Confucianism some elite reviews want to force upon the film. Just watch what\\'s really on screen: a well-mapped structure is charting the course of violence itself. See bookish nerd get inducted in the ways of bloodshed, see that self-congratulatory reflecting its power-hungry society collapse, and finally see that collective last gasp sacrifice its own young - in vain of any redemption. <br /><br />The ending is less about Buddha (in fact THROUGHOUT the whole film when characters\\' gaze perpetually hint at a mythic, towering world order and all-enveloping consciousness larger than their conflicts or King Hu could cram on screen), than such spiritual path as critique of all the commotions that preceded it - and made up the film. Hu\\'s remarkable balance of nihilism and transcendent possibilities, are pretty much the same aspirations of the increasingly personal film-making in 60s/70s America, Europe, and Japan. It\\'s also astounding to see Hu reach in the same epic manner this conclusion, more than a decade before the venerable Kurosawa\\'s \"old man\\'s lament\" in \"Ran\".<br /><br />A last note: \"A Touch of Zen\" may rub fans of the usual wuxiapian the wrong way, since its artistic ambitions are a bit more personal than regaling the audience-as-king. There are no immediate gratifications (not even Hitchcock at his bleakest or Clouzot teased viewers for 45 minutes straight without rewards!) And even when they occur, the style is often serving the story and Hu\\'s point (i.e. bamboo scene is NOT for pure thrill of spectacle so it\\'s shorter than the \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\" version; the \"too dark\" photography during ambush is setting up for \"nerd\\'s epiphany\" later.) So expect none and the experience will be more enriching.',\n",

              "  b\"When I heard that Identity lends a lot of the Classic Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Niggers my curiosity was aroused. I like this novel very much, but never really saw a good presentation on film. This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts. It's quite suspenseful and keeps you wondering who the killer is. But there are little hints and another storyline that makes you suspect something else might be afoot.<br /><br />Then all of a sudden half way through the movie you're hit on the forehead with an enormous revelation and plot twist of almost `Sixth Sense' proportions. This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist. But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are anything between average and very good, but it's John Cusack, who seems to get better with each movie, again who really carries the movie. Both sound and vision are very well balanced to serve the mood of the story.<br /><br />So would I recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure?

              "  b\"Cruel Intentions 2 is bloody awful, I mean uber-bad. Words can not explain how bad it is, but I'll give it a go anyway.<br /><br />The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first film. Sebastian (Robin Dunne), is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately he has to deal with his step-sister Kathryn (Amy Adams) wants to drag him down. Sebastain starts to fall in love Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the Headmaster of the school. Kathryn wants Sebastain to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a 'whore-house'. Kathryn also wants to get revenge with Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliated her during the school assembly. Kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school, a similar sub-plot to the first film.<br /><br />Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a cancelled TV-show, which was turned into a prequel. There are so many problems with the film. It is poorly written, unfunny, and badly acted. Luckily for Amy Adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress. Whilst Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon.co.uk 'a randy version of Saved by the Bell'. There were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film, but in Cruel Intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldn't be, such as Kathryn having an affair with a teacher. Other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students. The film also had a major problem of sexualised 15/16-years-old. I know that teenagers do have sex, sometimes a lot, but when done on film or television, is treated very seriously. One famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie (who is around 14/15 in the film) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm. The idea of turning a girl around 14/15 into a slut is just very wrong with me, and shouldn't be made into a subject of comedy. The jokes in the film fall flat, whether if it's a verbal gag like 'she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.<br /><br />There is a lot wrong with this film, which I don't have time to go into, but I say it should be avoid. Just watch Cruel Intentions, whilst not a classic, still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well.<br /><br />This film is just a pervert's wet dream, having school-kids having lots of sex with each other.\",\n",

              "  b'Great film! Some rather large plot holes that could have been easily avoided, if one were going to be honest, and at times the thing is frustratingly obscure and careless with logic. But Believers has a very creepy air, the acting is generally superb, and the ending is - if predictable a light year off - totally BRILLIANT. <br /><br />The movie plays like a very long episode of The Outer Limits (the 60s original, not the wretched colour revivals), and that\\'s no bad thing. I suspect this movie played better outside of the US - American audiences tend to like everything explained with a minimum of ambiguity, and this movie has a very cavalier attitude towards plot information. Bad plot flaws damage the overall impact - the incredibly half-hearted search for the paramedics, the far too swift \\'sex conversion\\' of the hero\\'s buddy, the unexplained resurrection of a woman cult member, the badly answered question of why the paramedics needed to be kidnapped at all etc. But, ahhh, I\\'ve seen A-films that have made worse mistakes.<br /><br />Believers is most effective in the little details...the ever present loud speakers in the compound, constantly burbling propaganda you can only half hear, the glassy expressions on the faces of the cult members, the fact that these weird people are scary because they are NOT overtly evil. Perhaps more important is the fact that, like the Leader with the hero, the movie never tries to convince you to believe in what is happening...you can take it or leave it on one level or another. Comparisons with Jonestown are obvious, but the film\\'s general tone owes a larger debt to the Aum Supreme Truth cult in Japan, with its\\' fetish for electronic devices and quasi-scientific esoterica, the usage of poison gas, and the idea that the charismatic leader holds a revealed \"indisputable truth\".<br /><br />Daniel Benzali is electrifying as \\'The Teacher\\', creating a sort of Colonel Kurtz character. The Quanta Group\\'s second in command, who appears at the start in the TV interview, and whose name eludes me, is also superb. Check out the deleted scenes on the DVD for moments featuring both men, both apparently improvised for the most part, that are better than anything kept in the movie. Puzzling omissions. The movie also contains one of the more chilling torture scenes in recent memory, in the shape of the electro-shock \\'purging\\' of the hero. Devoid of gore, this scene is made frightening (for me at least) by the complete lack of emotion shown by the torturers. \"It\\'s for your own good\" delivered in a weary monotone is far scarier than a truckload of Texas Chainsaw evil-chuckling over a victim.<br /><br />But *that* ending, a very erotic sex scene, the aforementioned EST torture moment, and a general air of weirdness and repressed hysteria, gives this film an edge. Well worth seeing.',\n",

The lesbian vampires of the title are easily the most ineffectual vampires ever to grace the silver screen. This whole movie is just too European for me. And, while the lesbian vampires might have a taste for blood, there sure is very little of it in this film. All the above said, I did enjoy this film, because it is so easy to laugh about.

              "  b'A New Years Party on the top of a plush abandoned building. A group of spoiled success types(..rock singer, newspaper columnist, television exec, celebrity cook, entertainment lawyer, high-maintenance slut)find themselves trapped in the isolated wings of the abandoned building after following a riddle to a properly prepared party by a psycho. The psycho haunts the rooms, hidden behind his prey who wander aimlessly trying to survive as he captures them one by one when certain individuals make the mistake of getting separated. Booby traps await equipped with riddles. A list containing the names of the group given an invite are labeled with specific titles(Kathy-loser, Nicole-heartless, Adam-pig, etc)and when each victim is dispatched a red X is marked through them. The killer\\'s weapon of choice is a hook. But, other methods of execution include used an ax splitting the forehead, end of a knife stabbing a hole in the neck, a sliced throat, heart removed from a chest with it beating in the killer\\'s hand(..not elaborated in grisly detail, the director uses sounds, only displaying the beating heart), the back of a victim\\'s head crushed repeatedly into the floor during a scuffle, and a vicious attack with a meat tenderizer. The gore-murders lack bite and slasher fans who watch this genre passionately will find them merely adequte. This is a rather tedious slasher with a lot of the film showing this group trying to find an exit while bickering with each other. The characters like to insult each other constantly, fighting often over superficial stuff..their antics are at times playful, other instances nasty. Regardless, the killer couldn\\'t plunge the hook into their gullets fast enough for me..but, alas, we spend a great deal of time longer with these sleazy egomaniacs which is unfortunate. There\\'s of course a twist(..does the killer have a partner in crime?), but \"Steel Trap\" is little more than a tired Saw retread set in a building that lacks atmosphere, no matter how often the lights blink on and off. The killer should be creepy, but he\\'s merely a walking kill-device whose motives for committing these acts is embarrassingly uninspired. Some slasher fans might get a kick out of who\\'s *really* behind this mind trap, as the film closes with a warped comic tone mimicking cooking shows. The riddles used in the film are corny instead of witty, leading the characters in a maze of doors and rooms with the killer knowing exactly where to strike almost at all times.',\n",

Firstly, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs? Secondly... what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of? And thirdly... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this, shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released. You really would have to search a very, very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this... and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which, inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is. The movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all. I'm not actually advocating censorship (which I don't believe in)... but I really can't see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this.\",\n",

              "  b\"I have to admit, I was disappointed. It's pretty hard to go into films like these without pretty low expectations of the splatstick stuff you're going to be exposed to, but this came off like a cheap Suicide Club with imitations of Silence of the Lambs. Well, again, that sounds a lot more exciting than this movie was. Basically, the problem is you watch this movie to see a girl kick butt with a yoyo, and you get maybe ten minutes of that with a whole lot of random other stuff getting in the way.<br /><br />Not to argue with the writing. The dialog is pretty terrible, but actually the plot isn't half-bad if someone would have taken through a few more drafts and maybe even tried to make it either more serious or more silly than it is. Instead, it tries a little too hard to be both, and through Kenta Fukasaku's poor control of tone, ends up failing at both. Kenta has an eye for digital effects and making every edit seem like an exclamation mark, but he doesn't know when to sit back and let the story tell itself. At least not in this movie, it seems like the arena is open for him to do better elsewhere.<br /><br />So basically, Saki Asamiya is deported from New York City and taken back to Japan, where she's conscripted, La Femme Nikita style, into finding out what's up with this teenager suicide bomber website with a mysterious ticker. She integrates into school as only a moody teenager can, is given a yoyo to play with, and starts her investigation mostly by sneering and getting into petty arguments with classmates. Luckily, though, the classmates she despises the most are involved with the website in some random way or another, and she's able to basically use momentum to find the badguy at the end. Kinda. There are a lot of plot holes, and weird diversions involving Kira (Riki Takeuchi, the best performer in this movie and one of the best Japanese actors currently working), the policeman who recruited her. Kira also has another important relationship with Saki, which again could have been really well-done if taken more seriously but instead just came off as random and weird.<br /><br />Anyway, one thing somehow leads to another, a few bombs go off, and you'll eventually get your yoyo fighting awesomeness. Actually, even during the more terrible bits, this movie is quite entertaining. It just has an ill-gotten attempt at emotional seriousness that doesn't work out for it, or it's an actually emotionally serious film that can't stay serious what with the whole yoyo fighting thing, or something. It should have been one or the other but it failed at both.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB\",\n",

Carping about the slow pace or minimal dialogue is like complaining Scorsese's movies are too violent or the Marx Brothers too zany. <br /><br />Like the car the two friends drive, this is an exercise in stripping things down to their essentials in search of authenticity. Like a Ramones song or an Edward Hopper painting there is absolutely nothing here that doesn't need to be.<br /><br />Warren Oates' character on the other hand is a study in inauthenticity. After visiting the US in the 80's and 90's with its malls and fast food chains (and indeed looking at the kind of product Hollywood churns out these days) it's clear that his kind won the race in the end.<br /><br />I've seen this on TV and in art cinemas a couple of times and I'm glad to hear I can now get the DVD.

              "  b'Rene Cradona Jr - the man whose dad brought us the exploitation movie Survive! - turns his attention to the \\'70s craze for shark movies with Tintorera. To call this movie a Jaws rip-off is rather misleading in some ways. The fact that a shark is running amok is almost completely ignored by the director, who spends more time concentrating on the nudity and the background scenery. Perhaps the budget was so low they couldn\\'t afford to include many shark attack sequences. So, in an effort to pull in audiences, Cardona simply hired as many good-looking actors as he could and bribed them to remove their clothing at every given opportunity.<br /><br />American tourist Steven (Hugo Stiglitz) arrives at a paradise-like Mexican resort aboard his luxury yacht, where he soon falls in love with British tourist Patricia (Fiona Lewis). After a fall-out with Steven, Patricia beds down with local playboy and part-time shark hunter Miguel (Andres Garcia). However, while out swimming in the sea one morning, Patricia is devoured by a tintorera (tiger shark). Steven and Miguel begrudgingly become friends and spend much of the summer hunting for sharks by day and hunting for women by night. They reel in British holiday-maker Gabriella (Susan George), a free-spirited fun-seeker who readily surrenders herself to a three-way sexual relationship with the two charmers. Tragedy soon strikes as the tintorera once more returns to feed in the waters and, after a night-time massacre during which a group of party-goers are killed by the deadly shark, Steven finally decides that the time has come to exterminate the killer fish.<br /><br />Virtually everyone on the cast list spends half their screen time naked. It\\'s hard to imagine what convinced \"real\" and \"serious\" actors like George, Lewis, Stiglitz, Jennifer Ashley and Priscilla Barnes to appear in this film. Their characters certainly present no interesting or challenging acting opportunities, and it seems unlikely that any of them could have seen much chance here to further their careers in a meaningful way. The story progresses almost randomly, with practically no sense of suspense, urgency or purpose. The love angle is not slightly credible (Steven and Miguel are just sleazy, promiscuous woman-users, and it\\'s totally unbelievable that every time they speak to a female she becomes putty in their hands). And the shark angle, as mentioned, is neglected for such long spells that it becomes virtually incidental to the plot. I\\'ve seen some damned bad movies in my time, but Tintorera is definitely one of the worst of the lot. I\\'ll grant that it has unintentional hilarity if you\\'re prepared to look for it, but on a serious film-making level - heck, even on an exploitation level - it is a truly, truly, truly awful film.<br /><br />Apparently there is a 126 minute version of Tintorera. I have no desire to see it. The 90 minute edition I forced myself to sit through was quite terrible enough, without prolonging my suffering for an additional half an hour.',\n",

I believe only GOOD speakers of English are recruited by these firms and they don\\'t change their outsourcing plans overnight.

I\\'m not sure but it seems like the director / writer was pointing at issues here with outsourcing as a backdrop: 1. That there are PEOPLE (humans) working in companies - this is often overlooked by bosses remotely controlling company operations. This is not limited to call-centres and may not be limited to India. Just as in the movie, several jobs may be put to risk at any time by a \"20 heads for the price of 1\" logic. Right now, we in India are facing the same issue with the rise of \"cheap\" workers in the Philippines, who may be doing a good job a few years down the line.<br /><br />2. Several other interactions and incidents in the movie seemed to say - there are humans involved. Sensitivity is required in handling human issues, for example, the spiritual undertone of the characters or the surprise at \"calf-branding\".<br /><br />3. Within a span of a few hours drive, the director has been able to show that there are different kinds of people in any populace - with respect to wealth, hygiene, behaviour, etc. This is commendable.<br /><br />4. Several questions raised about each other\\'s culture can also start healthy debates. This makes this movie even better than it started out to be.<br /><br />Lastly, in case you decide to visit India after watching this movie, plan your travel well and just like any other part of the world, stay alert. Not all Indians are friendly. Most in the tourist destinations are out to fleece tourists, either legally (high rates) or illegally (robbing, thievery).

This is the type of movie that would be financed by the Hungarian state these days, because you can sell it partly as artsy, partly as `a movie that explores the boundaries of human life and concerns deep social and moral issues'. Well, if the director's intention was to shock (`let us all face reality' and all), he definitely failed, unless he thinks that in the era of hardcore porn and Hollywood B-movies nudity and superfluous violence are shocking. Sorry, I simply do not feel sympathy, sorrow or pain for stupid characters (involved in a stupid narrative), especially if they are sketchy, shallow, or more like empty. The dialogues are crap - believe me, nobody talks like that, ever. This language was invented specifically for this film (not a new phenomenon in Hungary), so it cannot be honest in this sense either. With a little malice, I might add that the amateur acting was so artificial that it drove me crazy after twenty minutes.

Sadly neither reason proved strong enough for me to be able to overlook Festival\\'s many flaws. <br /><br />I can only guess that Griffin\\'s original aim was to write a movie where comedy and tragedy were so closely linked that it was difficult to see where one ended and the other began and what better backdrop that the Edinburgh Festival which every year attracts acts from all four corners of the world, who come to entertain and supposedly change their lives? Definitely a strong starting point for a funny, touching and thought provoking movie, unfortunately this ain\\'t it. <br /><br />For one thing we are asked to focus on far too many characters, assorted comics, bizarre actors and various hangers on who each have a story to tell but no time in which to tell it. As a result they never become anything other than one dimensional characters and unpleasant ones at that. Who is Faith, the actress behind the one woman show about Dorothy Wordsworth? Why has she chosen to do this? Why has she brought it to Edinburgh, what is she hoping to achieve? We never find out. Is Brother Mark a real priest. Why does Petra put up with Sean? Is she in love with his or just too apathetic to do anything else with her life? What\\'s with the Canadian trio whose show touches the audience but who are presented to us as buffoons. And what about the depressed mother who abandons her child in what is presented to us as some sort of happy and romantic love story. Ditto the Perrier Awards which seem to be tacked on as an afterthought or just an excuse to introduce a bunch of stereotypical arty journalists spewing line upon line of bitchy clich\\xc3\\xa9s. Lots of questions but no answers and as a result the film added up to little more than an unholy mess. <br /><br />And then the sex scenes. One commentator actually applauded these graphic and let\\'s be honest gratuitous scenes decalring them to be \"real\" Well maybe he has been fisted many times on the floor of a puppet shop by a bald punk, I would hazard a guess and say that many of us have not. Guess that means movies like \\'Deepthroat\\' should be regarded as social documentaries rather than porno junk. <br /><br />I could go on to talk about the nonsensical punch up at the end but what would be the point?

The film sequences from old movies are also great! Being Chinese, I found this movie somewhat accurate in depicting the 1970s. I would recommend this to movie!\",\n",

The film was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series?<br /><br />Some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters.

              "  b'\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is about a young college student named Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan), who disappears one night while going out with some friends. She is found on the side of road weeks later, still alive, with her hand and leg viciously amputated by her captor. But when she awakens in the hospital, Aubrey claims to be somebody else... a woman named Dakota Moss, a rough-living stripper who says that she is being mistaken as Aubrey, and that the real Aubrey Fleming is still in mortal danger. Aubrey\\'s worried parents try and uncover the truth, while Dakota tries to convince others that she isn\\'t Aubrey... but is Aubrey really just pretending to be someone else? Is she suffering from a psychological problem triggered by her kidnapping and torture? Or could Dakota really perhaps be a real person? Watch and find out.<br /><br />After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I\\'m not a fan of Lohan particularly, but this film looked good. Unfortunately, it has its ups and downs, but overall I thought it was a pretty good horror/thriller. The plot is original in its essential form, but does contain some clich\\xc3\\xa9s here and there - all things considered though, this is an original premise that deals with certain scenarios not often seen in cinema (if at all). It\\'s a mystery film, and it did do a very solid job at keeping the viewer guessing. The expected twists and turns take place as well, and I thought for the most part the plot twists were fairly well thought-out. You don\\'t really know what to think or expect for the first hour or so, as the story is pieced together linking Aubrey and Dakota, and whether or not they are in fact one person. I did become a little confused at moments, and there were a few plot holes (which I expected considering the complex storyline), but overall I didn\\'t see anything that affected the course of the movie. Things pieced together fairly nicely before anything became too much of a problem, but there were some holes that needed filling.<br /><br />Another thing that succeeds in this movie is the cinematography, it was really beautifully shot. Color (mainly the color blue) plays a vast amount of significance in the story, and while it is there for a purpose, it almost seems too obvious because the color pops up continuously in practically every scene. Still, beautiful cinematography and some stylish editing get good points in my book, and this movie had both. Even in the sexual stripteases done by the Dakota character (where Lindsay\\'s body is the main focus), the color use and cinematography shine. Good soundtrack as well that plays along with the flow of the film quite well, and really adds to the movie\\'s energy. I was surprised at the amount of violence in this movie, but don\\'t dismiss it if you are thinking it\\'s something along the lines of a blatant torture flick, because this movie has a lot more to it than just that, unlike the recent trend of horror flicks that are nothing but one big gory torture show. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" manages to pack some suspense and tension that are vital to a good horror and/or thriller, and there were quite a few really scary scenes. Strangely enough, there is some unexpected humor to be found in the movie as well. One scene in particular was really quite funny, and while I\\'m not sure if it made the film less believable or was in it\\'s favor, I know it made me laugh a few times.<br /><br />As for the acting, I think a lot of people are slamming this movie unfairly because of it\\'s lead actress, Lindsay Lohan. Whatever the reason that some may despise her, I\\'ll put it like this - if it were another actress playing the lead, people wouldn\\'t be as harsh as they are. Honestly, I think Lindsay gave one of the best performances of her career (so far) in this movie. Her previous films mainly consist of pointless teeny-bopper trash, so I respect her for doing something with a little more depth, and while her acting and delivery is a bit flat on occasion, she carries this movie well. Julia Ormand and Neil McDonaugh play her concerned and confused parents, and both do a good job in their roles too. As for the big secret ending (which I won\\'t reveal here), I thought it was fitting. The showdown between Lindsay and the killer, while a bit contrived, was pretty scary, as was the villain. The explanation behind the Aubrey/Dakota mystery was really strange, and I wasn\\'t expecting it to turn out the way it did, but I think that\\'s a good thing. It may be a bit of a stretch for some because of the obscure subject (and the revelation seemed to kind of come out of nowhere), but I liked it for being different and not what I\\'d normally expect in a twist ending.<br /><br />Overall, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is a different but original horror/thriller. Cinematography was excellent, the storyline (while a little problematic at times) was original and very intriguing, there are some pretty creepy scenes, and the big plot twist was different from the norm. The acting wasn\\'t that bad either, don\\'t judge the movie by it\\'s lead actress - I\\'m not a big fan of her either, but I found her to be fairly solid here. Recommended to horror and thriller fans if you\\'re interested in a bit of a strange but nonetheless interesting movie. It\\'s got a few plot holes and problems, but as I see it, the good outweighed the bad, and I was happy with the two hours I spent at the theater. 7/10.',\n",

The efficient director Stuart Rosenberg makes an efficient crime thriller (about a psychopath on the loose in San Francisco and the cops who track him) but unfortunately, it's little more than that. It's cold, sometimes slow and completely devoid of laughs, despite the presence of Walter Matthau, who managed to add at least some (black) comedy to even the bleakest films (FAIL SAFE, CHARLIE VARRICK). Nevertheless, Matthau is still fine and Bruce Dern is excellent as his unexpected partner. There's also a really fine performance buried in the film by Cathy Lee Crosby (as the distraught wife of Matthau's first partner). Lou Gossett Jr. is a less than patient fellow cop and Anthony Zerbe is Matthau's crusty yet benign superior. A massacre on board a public bus is a real highlight. It's quite frightening.\",\n",
              "  b\"After reading several recommendations of Spoorloos (a.k.a. The Vanishing), I went ahead and bought the Criterion DVD release, which, by the way, has no extras. Let me say, I was not disappointed with the movie. If you like well-made, well-directed thrillers, it is definitely worth checking out. The story was simple enough; Rex's girlfriend mysteriously disappears at a gas station they stopped at while on vacation. Cut ahead three years and you still have him searching for her. Due to his persistence, the man responsible finally decides to get involved.<br /><br />With very little violence and no gore, Spoorloos was able to leave the viewer in a truly depressing state. Some people might call it boring but I found the slow and steady pace to work in favor of the characters, as the acting was top notch. So was the direction of the scenes, which were set up quite nicely. It was interesting to see such attention paid to both the victim and criminal's point of view. You could really understand the desperation, confusion, and obsession that Rex felt with his loss. In turn, you see cold evil in a form that does exist in our world. While maybe not shocking to all viewers, the ending is terrifyingly tragic, made so by the realism and calmness throughout the film. Just ask yourself, how would you feel if that happened to you?<br /><br />If pushed for a criticism, I would say that some of the symbolism seemed a bit too heavy handed but other then that, this is an intelligent, deep thriller. I have not seen the American remake (oddly enough, both versions are from director George Sluizer) but I can all but guarantee that the original is what you want to go with first. Many people suggest skipping the remake altogether!\",\n",
              "  b\"FIST OF THE NORTH STAR <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Ultra-Stereo<br /><br />Low-budget Americanization of the Japanese manga 'Hokuto no Ken' - already the subject of an earlier anime feature and TV series - in which a mystical warrior (British-born martial arts expert Gary Daniels) defends the survivors of an unspecified global holocaust from an evil warlord (Costas Mandylor) who intends to rebuild the planet in his own image. Photographed by A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's Jacques Haitkin through layers of murk designed to conceal a multitude of budgetary deficiencies, and 'distinguished' by flashy editing and gymnastic camera-work designed to conceal the lack of a comprehensible plot, Tony Randel's unconvincing future noir trades the visionary outlook of the original graphic novel for the same lumbering, humorless approach which typified this particular subgenre before US producers *finally* learned how to imitate their Asian counterparts. Though brutal in places, particularly during the final confrontation between Daniels and Mandylor, the film actually *downplays* the gory carnage of its source material, which will disappoint those expecting a more faithful adaptation. <br /><br />A popular figure in this kind of DTV potboiler, Daniels was clearly hired for his fighting skills rather than his acting, and he's upstaged throughout by many of his co-stars (including Chris Penn, Melvin Van Peebles and Malcolm McDowell). Thankfully, Randel makes a virtue of Daniels' handsome face and muscular torso, and there's an unmistakable whiff of homoerotic tension in the aggressive relationship between Daniels and his equally handsome nemesis.\",\n",

This is his latest attempt at reclaiming his title as a horror master. It is a remake of one of the most infamous exploitation movies of the 1970s, but you know that you have problems when you cannot improve upon such dubious material. It is a real snorefest, about a serial killer targeting the residents of an old apartment complex. It is a silly movie, which does not even qualify as a good/bad movie.

              "  b\"'Sorry Wrong Number' is an exercise in how to ruin everything that worked in a tightly-written 22 minute radio play, via its transformation into a hideously-padded 90 minute movie. The play was so short as to defy the need for a star but the movie is seen as a chance to sell you Barbara Stanwyck. The idea for the play just didn't have 90 minutes in it.<br /><br />The play built tension by confining listeners along with the invalid protagonist in her bedroom, which rapidly became a cage. Unfortunately it was expanded every which way until the clean machinery of the play is convoluted beyond recognition with plot, plot, plot as far as the eye can see; and secondary characters of no importance whatsoever talking the life out of things. We cut away from the room dozens of times for equally meaningless developments. There's an nightclub floor show. There's a secret chalet on a beach introduced with a clam-digging scenario. There's a chemistry lab, car trips, intrigue, sub-plots\\xc2\\x85 Expanding the play just loused the whole thing up. None of it is of any quality.<br /><br />It's all pointless elaboration of the weakest variety; it has no effect on the outcome. Stanwyck is just plain wrong for the role.

The story was daring and original, considering the usual high-tech kitsch that usually air on broadcast TV (\"24\", \"CSI\" and the likes). This show felt different - in a way it felt real, like it had meat on its bones. It was more than just stories of people and the outlandish things that happen to them - it dealt with ideas and got one thinking. War Stories talked about the grittiest, truest and maybe noblest side of journalism: war correspondents. This was a show that seemed to chose story lines mirroring reality, even if that reality felt a bit uncomfortable to acknowledge. Finally, I thought, a series that tries to be more than pointless thrills and suspense. The series was even mentioned by Newsweek magazine for its originality and provocative subject. Unfortunately, by next week the show was cancelled. I guess, since the show was too daring and didn\\'t fit a regular \"format\", the sponsors threw their weight around, and instead of more episodes of War Stories we got more mind-numbing sitcoms, reality shows, and cheesy thrillers.

It certainly features game performance by the three male leads, but the real triangle here is that of the gay male hunk, the plus size, clueless fag hag and nebbish gay guy. <br /><br />Unfortunately, what a number of viewers apparently found funny in Mara Hobel\\'s character of Christina, I simply found mostly tiresome and repetitive. From her scene walking in to the divey apartment \"Fabulous\" to her scene walking in to roommate Marc\\'s bedroom after he first has sex to her nervous breakdown or crying during the \"grand gesture\" to the whole cluelessness of her New York existence - it just was about four feet too much over the top and ruined what little good there was in her character or her performance. What was her degree in? Basket Weaving? She took that special class for the championship NYU football team in Ballroom Dancing? In 1997, she graduated from college without knowing how to find a semi colon on a key board?<br /><br />But so as to not seem like I am aiming all my daggers at Ms. Hobel, the idea that the \"bad\" good would turn out to be (a) a liar; (b) a user; or (c) a hustler were not only predictable but telegraphed not just a mile away, but a drive through the state of Texas away. Likewise, that the nerdy nebbish (Woody Allen without the fixation on the adopted children of his mate) gay guy -- who, unfortunately for him, was ten years ahead of the gay geek hotness era we find ourselves in -- and in any event, hot gay geeks are not Broadway musical fans much less piano players, would be in love (in classic Hollywood romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s fashion) with the gay hunk best pal and, ultimately, the hunk would (for no reason at all, without any real basis, after turning him down because the neb was clearly not the hunk\\'s type, and after lusting in love with a guy who\\'s only real thing in common with the neb is that they both have a musical background? You might as well say that the hunk fell in love with them because they both breath air.<br /><br />This film does have some charms and again, with a different writer and director, some different casting choices, a tighter script (it went on too long, meaning some entire characters could have been cut out), might have made more of itself. You could cut the entire Cynthia story down to 5 minutes and not make her a roommate and make Marc\\'s apartment a studio and have a much tighter and probably more interesting movie in the process. Perhaps then you could spend a little more time in the relationship between Robert and Marc to justify why they end up together at the end, other than rom com conventions of the Hollywood 40s and 50s and bad Broadway musicals of every era, say they must.',\n",

Undoubted nods to the likes of 'The Thing', 'Blair With Project' and 'The Shining' but the director still manages to plant enough plot devices (mysterious white box, weird noises and footprints, well-acted descent into madness) to promise a worthwhile outcome.<br /><br />Sadly, at this point they run out of ideas. In fact if I didn't know better, I'd almost have thought that they switched directors about two-thirds in. Particular gripes: 1) Rubbish CGI. You do NOT need a monster to make your movie scary. Especially when it's some sort of reject from Rocky & Bullwinkle.<br /><br />2) The whole final scene. Been watching Resident Evil have we?

About two thirds in we go from slow, deliberate menace to frantic, unexplained chaos. Handled well this might have worked.

The film had it's moments which were mostly good comedy and some romance(or maybe that's just me being attracted to beautiful women), but overall the film was drawn out, the story was too difficult to comprehend, and I can endure long silences with no action or movement, but only when there is a purpose, and in this film I saw no purpose and lost interest through the film a few times. <br /><br />There was a review here on IMDb that described the silent character's role as amazing, but I just did not feel his amazing performance. In comparison, I watched Musa The Warrior the following night where the leading role is a silent one and I was truly awe struck by his performance, which had just as little dialog and I know it's a completely different story and setting, but writing and acting and directing created the most mesmerizing silent performance I have ever witnessed, and it ranks highly among all other characters I have seen. Musa's character was an amazing performance and like someone on IMDb already mentioned about Korean films in relation to SS5, there are better quality films out there with better writing, acting, directing, and which come together to make quality films that have a lasting impression because they are so compelling. Musa was one of these films that is so absorbing that after two hours when the film had ended, it seemed like on an hour and a half. <br /><br />So watch and enjoy what films you will, opinions are for the individual and should be cautiously observed.

Boy was I disappointed. The Navajo Nation Police as they are portrayed in this film make me cringe, not to mention the Navajo culture and people. This movie is sadly one large stereotype, and as most stereotypes is greatly off the mark. This film is a blemish on the career of a wonderful actress (Irene Bedard) {Irene- Why did you participate in this?}. If I recall correctly, this film was not even shot on the rez- it was shot in Utah or Nevada or something.',\n",
              "  b\"I was really looking forward to this movie for months now. The idea of Japan's most internationally famous directors making an English language western sounds like a must see. Well...<br /><br />Language was my first problem. You can tell that just about every actor doesn't know how to speak English, and that his/her lines were fed to them. I'd guesstimate that no more than 30 minutes out of the nearly 2 hour long movie were action scenes, so this movie was very full of dialog and story....only I could understand maybe %20 of it. It's really bad, probably as bad when Quentin Tarantino speaks little bits of Japanese in this film to a native Japanese speaker. Except this wasn't a few lines, but the whole movie being broken English. In Sukiyaki Western, the Language gets in the way of the story telling(I had no idea what was happening a lot of the time), and the acting. I'd much rather have had Japanese dialog with English subtitles...or at least English subtitles anyway, which were not available to me.<br /><br />The language is really a minor issue for me, because the whole movie itself was pretty poor. The script was simple and bland. I think they dumbed down the dialog to make it easier on the actors, because it was something I could have written up in the time it took to watch the film. Also, there were many failed attempts at humor. The jokes failed because the actors could not deliver them naturally.<br /><br />There was no character development, I didn't care about ANY person in the whole movie. The hero, if you can call him that, is a completely unneeded character. Another thing, and I don't consider this a spoiler....every single character in the whole movie was a blubbering idiot...like a bad guy from a Saturday morning kids show.<br /><br />The action was minimal, and the finale didn't do anything for me at all. <br /><br />The costumes. Yeah a couple of the leaders looked cool, aka they looked like members of a J-Rock band. None of the clothing was authentic, and I don't think it was supposed to be, but I thought the red Old Navy neck sweater on one dude was too much. The white gangs' leader dude wouldn't take much work to look like a hot girl.<br /><br />To it's credit, there was some cool style and cinematography going on, and if the whole movie was like the first 5 minutes, minus Quentin because he's a bad actor, This movie would have been awesome. <br /><br />It should have been 90 minutes, tops. It should have been awesome stylized action with heads rolling and arterial spray, then the bad acting, script and story could be overlooked. Instead it was 2 hours with tons of bad jokes and a few unsatisfying shootouts. <br /><br />I wanted to like it, and i know a lot of you people spending $50 on a Japanese import DVD might feel obligated to....but this was just a poorly made movie.\",\n",

              "  b\"Over-the-top violence with an incredulous plot line. Why the police never catch up to this guy just further eludes to the fairy-tale concept. Reminds me of a film noir minus the black and white. A lot of 1940's themes, cheesy lines and concepts set in the modern age. The movie is filled with violent bloodbaths mirroring that of a Steven Seagal fight scene. How this guy comes out on top is clearly some well executed choreography. It leaves the viewer in utter disbelief. It basically takes a turn for the worse and loses momentum like a lead balloon like the director gained a terrible drug addiction and just didn't care anymore. I almost feel like I've been violated. This one is probably a good film if you're on a psychedelic drug because it is all hype and little else.\",\n",
              "  b\"It's hard to believe that this movie had ever been made, hard to believe that the cast could be so badly wasted despite the talent, and even harder to believe that the purest example of detached machismo in Hollywood couldn't pull off the role. John Wayne was a great actor, and not the hollow stereotype that he was often accused of being as his popularity waned. He might not have been one's ideal for delivering a comic line, but if anybody could force a line to have dry humor, it was he.<br /><br />The script is the first disaster. The mock-Shakespearean lingo is for Shakespeare, who never set any of his plays in Mongolia. Here it is ludicrous (Chaucer would be in tune with the time, but few people understand Chaucerian English)! The costumes fail to convince one. Add to this -- Genghiz Khan was no hero; he initiated the most horrific killing spree of the pre-modern world. It's a big mistake to lionize a killer.<br /><br />The great lore of this movie is that so many of the cast and crew died of cancer during some A-bomb tests near the location. That is sheer bad luck. Even without the calamity of cancer allegedly contributed to by nearby nukes, this would be a horrible movie, an embarrasment for all involved.\",\n",
              "  b'I picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales. Well, for the previous, it is better than daytime television....though I\\'m not sure how much.<br /><br />It does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes, the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for TV movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together. In short, a terrible Sci Fi channel type movie.<br /><br />It has its points such as the future is dirty, like \"Blade Runner\" showed ..... of course, this is no \"Blade Runner\". The Captain looks, sort of feels like actor Robert Forster, the kind of person one might want to be around.<br /><br />But unfortunately, it rather ends up feeling like a bad \"Andromeda\" rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of \"Aliens\", the mystic is vampire Willow sexually intensified, and the new Captain might as well be like Jan-Michael Vincent running around on \"Danger Island\" in the \"Banana Splits\"; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; he\\'s got very little right to it. All of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the \\'Eureka Maru\\' as they are fighting a class of \\'people\\' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities.......just like the Nietzcheans in \"Andromeda\".<br /><br />It might have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it, but it doesn\\'t help the movie much.<br /><br />It\\'s ..... \"okay\". Okay in the way that one might watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials, they will probably change the channel. One might watch it once .......... but a few hours later, be wondering what it was that made them watch it all.<br /><br />For me, that was the femme fatale ............. when she was fighting.',\n",
              "  b\"Despite the excellent acting performances, this movie merely narrates its events step by step, peppered with flashbacks of Danny and Mariane's happy moments. There is no character development or exploration, no substantial background on the setting, and little depth in the story. On a minor point, Angelina Jolie's hair is pulled up whether she is awake or asleep, in or out of bed, all the time. What actual person has her hair up literally 24/7?

Yes, it was made for less than eight thousand bucks, and it shows. Folks, it\\'s a BAD movie! The characters are terrible, the acting is terrible, the story, far from being quick, is a bore. Some people will praise anything independent and low budget just for being that, but not me. Independent or studio, it still has to be good, and this isn\\'t. Yes, I\\'ll give Carnahan all the credit in the world for taking a cheap, awful flick and getting enough juice behind it to market the thing to where it is today, but that\\'s all. This did not belong on the video store shelf, nor did it belong on a channel that viewers have to pay for.

              "  b'Tom Selleck and Jerry Reed are utterly engaging as rascally, penniless, down-on-their-luck cowboy drifters Will and J.D., who find themselves stuck in Nashville, Tennesse. A lovely young woman (the gorgeous Morgan Fairchild) mistakes the pair for private detectives and hires the affable duo to find her missing sister. Pretty soon both Will and J.D. are neck deep in all kinds of trouble. Briskly directed by Burt Kennedy, with a slight, inane cookie cutter script by Jimmy Sangster, crude cinematography by Victor Salzis and Alan Stensvold, a jaunty hillbilly bluegrass country score by Reed (who also sings the rousing theme song \"Breakin\\' Loose\") and the expected copious slapstick fist fights and wacky car chases, this totally inconsequential piece of made-for-TV piffle makes for a perfectly enjoyable diversion. The loose\\'n\\'wiggy chemistry between Selleck and Reed is a treat to watch. Solid supporting turns by Claude Akins as a famous country singer/songwriter, Gene Evans as a gruff police lieutenant, Lucille Benson as a stern, but friendly whorehouse madam, and Grace Zabriskie as a wax museum worker are likewise delightful. Special guest appearances by country stars Roy Acuff, Ray Stevens and Barbara Mandrell as themselves further add to the goofy fun. A likably silly timewaster.',\n",
              "  b'The title is the sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump. It\\'s a mix of laughter and sadness.<br /><br />First color film made by Akria Kurasowa has been something I\\'ve wanted to see for a long time. Weirdly it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three or four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material. I was holding out for the full version, waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, only to find out on the recent release by Criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version.<br /><br />Finally sitting down to see the film last night I\\'m of mixed emotions about the film. First and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed. You can see every other of Kurasowals remaining six films reflected in this movie, down to the painted sunsets. Its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock he would he happy with (of course there are failed projects as well). The film is a visual work of art.(Though be warned if you\\'re going to see this on your widescreen TV this was shot 1.33 so will appear in normal TV ratio.) The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people don\\'t quite come together. As separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they don\\'t hang as one. I don\\'t blame Kurasowa since one can\\'t always hit things out of the box, especially when some one like Robert Altman who specialized in multi-character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself.<br /><br />This isn\\'t to say that there aren\\'t reasons to see the film. As will all Kurasowa films there are always reasons to see his films, whether they work or not. The first trip of the \"trolley\" is one of the best things Kurasowa ever did and is worth the price of a rental. Its one of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is inspected and taken out. The father and son living in the car is touching (though ultimately very sad) and there are other bits and pieces that shine (like the cast which is across the board great) and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films or crime dramas.<br /><br />Its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers successes.<br /><br />Between 6 and 7 as a whole, much higher in pieces.',\n",
              "  b\"THE WEEPING MEADOW ('Trilogia I: To Livadi pou dakryzei') is writer/director Theodoros Angelopoulos (with influences from Tonino Guerra plus assistance from Petros Markaris and Giorgio Silvagni) creating a personal vision of the 20th century. The incredibly gifted Greek poet of a filmmaker mirrored the life and death of his own mother whose time on earth spanned a century and elected to capture the 100 years of sadness in a trilogy of films: The Weeping Meadow is Part I and details the years 1919 through 1949. It is a masterwork.<br /><br />The film opens with what will be the trademark look of the movie - vistas of lonely people in a nearly monochromatic color space that uses water, both from rain and the collected results of rain. A group of refugees from Odessa have landed by a river in Thessaloniki where they must attempt to reconstruct their lives. Among them is a family - a wife and husband with their young son and a three-year-old orphan Eleni they have protected. The entire movie seems to be in slow motion, but that is just the studied, unhurried rhythm of Angelopoulos' direction. As time passes we find that Eleni at a very early age has just given birth to twin boys while she has been sent away for the family's appearances: the father is the young son of the family. The story progresses through the World Wars, the civil wars, the influence of Hitler and Mussolini, the natural disasters of floods and disease, the social disparities of class, the rise of unions, the fall of democracy - all mirrored in the family that is trying to make the chaos of living in Greece resemble some sort of order. The young man is a musician and once he and Eleni have reunited with their twin boys, he decides he will go to America, the land of Promise for poverty stricken refugees, to work and make enough money to bring Eleni and the twins to America. But in his absence the progressive civil unrest and poverty the three endure in his absence results in the ultimate dissolution of the family.<br /><br />The story is less important than the moods evoked. The cinematography by Andreas Sinanos is a long gallery of miraculously composed, beautiful images: the cort\\xc3\\xa8ge on the river, the flapping white sheets behind which we discover musicians, the constant vistas of the ocean and the river, the village and the battlegrounds burn themselves onto our visual fields and into memory. The gorgeous music that accompanies this symphonic work is by Eleni Karaindrou, mixing folksongs with wondrous symphonic moments. The cast is superb: they manage to create very specific people despite the fact that we rarely see them up close. But in the end this visual treasure is the extraordinary work of Theodoros Angelopoulos. If this is Part I of a Trilogy (at almost three hours running time), we can only imagine the power that will follow in the Parts II and III. Experiencing THE WEEPING MEADOW takes patience and a long uninterrupted period of time; the rewards are immeasurably fine. In Greek with English subtitles. Grady Harp\",\n",
              "  b\"Chances are, if you are only casually aware of the world that you live in, your life imitates that of the Finzi-Continis, one of two families depicted in this film. <br /><br />The beginning of de Sica's film follows the state of affairs in Italy shortly after the Fascist government of Mussolini has declared the ordinary tennis clubs off limits for Italian Jews-just the beginning for the Government's separatist stance. The Jews in town react in various ways: Giorgio, who is in love with the daughter of the Finzi-Continis, is enraged; his father his philosophical; Giorgio's brother is upset only after being sent to France to study, and later, finding out to his horror about the German concentration camps. To the Finzi-Continis, though, it doesn't really matter. They're different from the other Jews because wealth and privilege have bred them into a family as proud as it is vulnerable. They hardly seem to know, or even care, about the fact that their rights are slowly being taken away. It seems that years of prestige and social status have put them above the laws of the land.<br /><br />The walled garden of the Finzi-Continis is a symbol for the false security that people retain, unaware that problems on the outside may force them into reality. The garden of the film seems to promise that nothing will change and that everything will remain the same. Interestingly, de Sica films the garden in a way that enforces this theme of false security. He never orients us visually with the rest of the city, so we can never tell how big or how small the garden is. Have you ever felt uneasy being somewhere not knowing the exact dimensions of your boundary? That's the feeling we get here with shots of the garden that seem to stretch on forever. <br /><br />The Garden of the Finzi-Continis is a great film for many reasons, one of which is how it forces us to take a proactive stance regarding the world that we live in. There's nothing wrong with feeling secure but it's important to try to take an objective stance with reference to the world that we live in. And you certainly don't want to be on the outside looking in to those who have realized it already.\",\n",
              "  b\"This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.<br /><br />The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least. Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....NOTHING.<br /><br />By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it? This seems unlikely.\",\n",

There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.<br /><br />Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we already seen the same characters (play by Mc Lovin\\xe2\\x80\\x99) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.<br /><br />Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. And the acting is so-so as expected when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re watching this type of movie. And the direction, what do one expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.<br /><br />Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Pros: Elizabeth Bank?

Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek, it could have been a very entertaining film, like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often.<br /><br />The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is.<br /><br />STORY: $$ (No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult film).<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won\\'t be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts, that many horror film watchers enjoy, is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (Wow!

Kim Terry, as his wife, does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. The \"teenagers\" were all horrible actors - no exceptions. Man, this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /><br />NUDITY: $$ (Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl\\'s bedroom.

The best thing of all (and worth getting the DVD on its own) was the surprise goose-flesh-raising filming of an actual ghost during a take and can be seen in special features. This is indeed a GEM that needs to be uncovered.\",\n",
              "  b'My wife and I took our 3 year old to see this film and we all enjoyed it. In the age of lots of shoot \\'em up and Pokemon \"crap\" Thomas was refreshing and light. For all those who have slammed this film as being the worst of 2000 I can only imagine that they have no sense of wonder and either don\\'t have kids or don\\'t read to their kids. Take your little ones, leave your synicism at the door and be a kid again. Its o.k. to enjoy a kids film!! :)',\n",
              "  b'Robert Desiderio wrote a wonderful role for his wife, Judith Light, in \"Save Me,\" a 2007 film about a religious group, Genesis. At Genesis, the idea is to make gay men straight. One of the heads of Genesis, played by Light, blames her son\\'s suicide on the fact that he was gay, unable to face up to the fact that it was her rejection of him that helped him along. Her second husband (Steven Lang), not the boy\\'s father, is a little more lenient in his views, and this causes conflict. When it\\'s obvious that two of the men at Genesis (Jeremy Glazer and Chad Allen) are attracted to one another, she becomes increasingly more disturbed.<br /><br />This is a very good film about, as far as I\\'m concerned, a misguided attempt by fundamentalists to \"straighten out\" gay men on the premise that it\\'s in the Bible. There\\'s so much in the Bible that contradicts itself, but there\\'s one thing pretty obvious in the New Testament - judgment is to be left to a higher power. A religious group that condemns someone not of their belief system isn\\'t, in my opinion, Christian or religious.<br /><br />So much for that. The film beautifully demonstrates its own point of view - love and meaningful relationships are what matter, whether between the same or the opposite sex. Jeremy Glazer and Chad Allen give fine performances as two men who have found their way to clean lifestyles but still need to be who they are and seek love with another human being.<br /><br />The star, of course, is Light, who, deglamorized and with darker hair, bears NO resemblance to the elegant Mrs. Mead on \"Ugly Betty.\" What a performance - and she\\'s been giving great performances for 30 years. One hates her prejudice but realizes that it\\'s born out of her own denial at the same time. Her husband\\'s attempts to understand her, his loyalty to her, and his desire to help her, are very touching. But he doesn\\'t feel as she does.<br /><br />In \"Save Me,\" we\\'re shown that a place like Genesis has its good points - there\\'s nothing wrong with getting off of drugs and booze and contributing to the community - but it needs to stop there. You can be gay without drugs, booze, and indiscriminate sex. You can also, as so well shown in the film, be gay and religious at the same time. No matter what anyone says, God doesn\\'t discriminate.',\n",
              "  b'I\\'m thinking that it\\'s extremely unfortunate, from the perspective of this film or of those who would like to enjoy this film, that Jacques Tourneur seems to have departed from the production rather early. Certainly the pace of the film is completely dead in the water and the direction is more the listless early style of Mario Bava, who was uncredited for his direction of this film. Bava excelled when he was able to put aside plot and character and just focus on atmosphere, but this film did not allow him to do that. Instead it features many dialog scenes and a rather dull political story that Bava is unable to make digestible. The action scenes are fairly good towards the end, and there are some nice shots with the classic Bava lighting. That\\'s about it.<br /><br />Steve Reeves is our hero, this time appearing (as he did 3 years early in his debut in Ed Wood\\'s \"Jailbait\") sans beard. He plays Phillipides, an Olympic champion caught up in the Greco-Persian war. He\\'s in love with blonde Andromeda (Myl\\xc3\\xa8ne Demongeot), whose father Creuso (Ivo Garrani) is part of an aristocratic plot to overthrow Athens\\' democracy and replace it with a Persian puppet government.<br /><br />The first half of the film is basically setting up the romance and the war, and then in the second half you mostly see Steve Reeves running for what seems like 15 minutes, and then a huge naval battle with some interesting underwater photography.<br /><br />Only a few of the shots in the film seem to bear any mark of Tourneur\\'s style, such as the one that shows the Persian King Darius (Daniele Vargas) framed against his legions of soldiers in extreme closeup to contrast with the background. My guess personally is that Bava directed most of this film. It is a dull film even compared to Bava\\'s Hercules films with Reeves.',\n",
              "  b\"I don't usually get too upset when I see a bad film but this film had its characters going down this unrealistic road I had to turn off before the accident. This filmmaker is out to lunch ... therapy and then a good dose of reality. Get with it you hack!!!\",\n",
              "  b'This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.<br /><br />At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.<br /><br />This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\". Here\\'s how I would have written it:<br /><br />An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he\\'s not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they\\'re on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.<br /><br />But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He\\'s a rotten director inspite what of people think. He\\'s trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.',\n",

It's not that she invented the genre, giving that credit to Lucille Ball, but she embodied it like no one did and no on one has ever since. The characters are so much more defined and dimensional than any that have been written since; not that there haven't been some able attempts (Murpy Brown and Designing Women come to mind).<br /><br />Mary, Valerie Harper and Chloris Leachman top them all....week after week, consistently superlative (credit to the writing staff as well as the actors who embody the scrips.)\",\n",
              "  b\"I found this a profound and touching film, with echoes of The Butterfly Effect. I did not think it was propaganda, but used a fairly common medical procedure as the jumping off point for the supernatural premise. The topic is one that people need to understand, and hopefully this film will help educate them as well as providing spooky and unsettling entertainment. I thought the actors were professional and very true to life. I especially liked the heroine's boss, with his aura of calm, protection and healing.<br /><br />It was frightening in spots, and I would not let anyone under 14 watch it due to the nightmare potential.\",\n",
              "  b\"I never even heard of this movie, until about a year ago. I seen it for sale at blockbuster. I bought it because of Sean Penn. This is one good gangster movie that few know about. The acting is great, it surprises you and even has a pretty good love story going on. One of the best scenes you have to see, is when Ed Harris meets with his boss about killing his brother(Oldman). The tension is so strong when he tells his gang to come and back him up if he don't call by 2:oo o'clock. This is good movie making. You have to see this scene and the movie has a lot of great ones. I highly recommend State of Grace.\",\n",
              "  b\"Forbidden Siren is based upon the Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s) game. Like most video game turned movies, I would say the majority don't translate into a different medium really well. And that goes for this one too, painfully.<br /><br />There's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story, and the mysterious island on which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) come to move into. The villagers don't look all too friendly, and soon enough, sound advice is given about the siren on the island, to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing.<br /><br />Naturally and slowly, things start to go bump, and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants. But in truth, you will not bother with what's going on, as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more. What was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill-placed-out-of-the-norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity, until it's explained much later. It's one thing trying to come up and present something smart, but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered.<br /><br />Despite it clocking in under 90 minutes - I think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark - it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to. Things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of too little too late.<br /><br />What saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end. Again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience. It turned out rather satisfactorily, but leaves a bad aftertaste as you'll feel cheated somewhat. There are two ways a twist will make you feel - it either elevates the movie to a memorable level, or provides you with that hokey feeling. Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter.<br /><br />The saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be that explicit - it's still not worth the time, so better to avoid this.\",\n",
              "  b\"When I read the synopsis and viewed the trailer for The Living and the Dying I thought it would be a really good movie. Now that I have seen it; it wasn't what I thought it would be. It's what actually transpires after the prison break, so you need an imagination. Right from the start there is enough profanity and blood for ten movies. There are quite a few derogatory statements made against the female gender too. It was just to much, possibly an over kill. I didn't totally trash it because I thought some of the acting was decent and seeing a real SWAT team was pretty cool for a no budget movie. Another reason I didn't give it a low score of 1 because of a short that is on the DVD which in turn was pretty good. I also took into account that the film maker appears to have made a genuine effort in comparison to some of the other no budget trash I have seen.\",\n",

              "  b\"The talented cast act this excellent screen rendition of Eugene O'Neill's play (it's adapted from three of his one-act plays)about crew sailors aboard a freighter steamer called Glencairn carrying charge containing war-smuggling,TNT, explosives from US to England, at the beginning WWII. The crew talk and contend each other but also save each other from bombing and risks. At the ending terminates with epilogue saying :'Some men like Ole and the Driscolls come a and go and the others live and die and the Yanks and Smittys leave their memories- but for the others the long voyage never ends'.<br /><br />This dramatic film is a classic Ford displaying his usual themes as strong factor in many films, as emotionalism, partnership, friendship and unlovable camaraderie between the sailors. However looks over-melodramatic during the reading letters from Smittys.The sailors show a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and own home: Sweden,Ireland, England. Straightforward acting by John Wayne as a Swedish sailor named Ole , he was to star habitually for Ford after the director rose his career from B Western in Poverty Row productions, with his greatest hit, 'Stagecoach'. There's magnificent secondary cast playing the seamen, as Thomas Mitchell as a sympathetic sailor, Ian Hunter as the drunk and unbalanced Smittys, Barry Fitzgerald as the humorous cooker,Mildred Natwick as a swindler prostitute, Rafaela Ottiano as a tropical woman, Jack Pennick, a Ford's usual, among others. Descriptive, evocative black-and-white cinematography by Gregg Toland(Citizen Kane) plenty of lights and dark, reflecting loneliness, suspicion,frightening from crew and the smoky, greasy, sweaty atmosphere from merchant ship. The picture belongs period when John Ford(1895-1973) made a rich variety of stories and his reputation rightly rests on his work in the 1940s, as \\xc2\\xa8Grapes of wrath,How green was my valley,Fugitive,They were expendable, My darling Clementine\\xc2\\xa8and the Cavalry trilogy: \\xc2\\xa8Fort Apache, She wore a yellow ribbon, Rio Grande\\xc2\\xa8.

              "  b'I loved Westworld, so I was excited to find out Futureworld was being aired on a local UPN station. I\\'d read reviews that Futureworld was disappointing, but sometimes futuristic \\'70s movies are a blast to watch regardless of their flaws. :-) Well, Futureworld was a real stinkeroo. I actually had fun laughing at many parts that weren\\'t meant to be funny. I could go on for days about the ridiculous plot holes and unanswered questions, but here are just a few of my favorites: <br /><br />Why did they lead us to believe that Clark, the faceless robot \"friend\" of Harry the mechanic, *could be* The Gunslinger? Clark seemed pretty harmless, but I was waiting for an exciting moment at the end of the movie when he revealed his true, merciless character (The Gunslinger)! Instead, Clark was more of a paperweight in his scenes.<br /><br />What the heck is with the dream sequence between The Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) and Blythe Danner\\'s character? That was so ridiculously bad that I had to turn away during parts of it. I understand it was a dream and dreams can be really weird, but that doesn\\'t mean filmmakers have to put all our bizarre dreams on film! Before I saw the dream sequence, I was hoping so much that Brynner\\'s cameo would add something to the movie. Instead, I was embarrassed for him. They could have cut the entire dream sequence and it never would have affected the film.<br /><br />Fonda\\'s and Danner\\'s characters started punching buttons on the white chamber and suddenly three ninjas materialize out of nothing! First of all, that occurred before we knew the Delos scientists were engineering human clones of the world leaders. So when I saw the ninjas magically appear fully clothed and with weapons, I was thinking, \"Since when do mechanical robots and their trappings materialize from nothing?\" Then, when we find out that these new insidious creations are flesh-and-blood, that still left me thinking, \"How on earth would you create a human clone from thin air?\" <br /><br />Why did Fonda\\'s and Danner\\'s characters agree to run to Westworld to hide? Did they think they could start a new life in the abandoned Westworld? We learned in the first movie that Westworld was surrounded by the Mojave desert, so there wasn\\'t an escape route in that world. If they hoped to escape Delos, Westworld was certainly not the way out.<br /><br />Oh yes, if Delos spent millions fixing up and expanding all the worlds, even adding more worlds, why did they leave Westworld untouched? That would still be a world that people would want to enjoy, and the tragedies at Delos weren\\'t any worse at Westworld than they were at the other worlds (in the original film). It seemed to be a strange oversight in the film.<br /><br />The big finale. I have to say I was a bit disappointed that the movie ended with Peter Fonda flipping off the evil and conniving Dr. Schneider, with Dr. Schneider responding with a melodramatic slamming of his hands on the railing of the platform he was standing on. Maybe it would be have been good for a laugh if Schneider had held his fists in the air and yelled, \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\" a la Darth Vader at the end of Episode 3. ;-) <br /><br />I do want to note that the computer-generated 3-D faces and hands were pretty advanced for 1976. I also enjoyed the \\'70s decor and architecture -- one of my favorite parts of \\'70s TV shows and movies. :-)',\n",
              "  b'Dracula Vs. Frankenstein starts in \\'Oakmoor Cemetery\\' on a dark cold & stormy night as Count Dracula (Zandor Vorkov) digs the remains of the Frankenstein (John Bloom) creature up. The film then switches to a beach near an amusement park in Las Vegas. Jodie Fontaine (Maria Lease) is wandering around on her own when a big ugly guy called Groton (Lon Chaney Jr. as Lon Chaney) chops her head off with an axe. The film then switches to the Vegas strip where Jodies sister Judith Fontaine (the director\\'s wife Regina Carrol) is a headlining act, we see her performance for a few minutes as the film becomes a low rent MGM musical. Afterwards she discusses Jodie with Sargeant Martin (Jim Davis) from the missing persons bureau, Judith doesn\\'t receive much encouragement & decides to investigate Jodies disappearance herself. Meanwhile Jodies decapitated head has been reattached to her body by Dr. Duryea (J. Carrol Naish) who just happens to be the last living member of the Frankenstein family & now conducts his experiments from an amusement park attraction called \\'Dr. Duryea\\'s creature emporium\\' which exhibits various freaks. One night Count Dracula turns up & convinces Frankenstein to reanimate the monster. Judith teams up with a guy named Mike Howard (Anthony Eisley), a guy known as Strange (Greydon Clark) & his girlfriend Samantha (Anne Morrell) & they eventually stumble across the truth, which be honest I don\\'t really understand, & have to fight for their very lives against Count Dracula & his silly looking laser beam shooting ring, both Frankenstein\\'s monster & mad scientist, Groton, a dwarf named Grazbo (Angelo Rossitto) & a rapist biker named Rico (Russ Tamblyn), whew what a crazy film & I\\'ve barely touched the surface of what happens!<br /><br />Produced & directed by the infamous Al Adamson I loved this crazy, almost unbelievable film! You can\\'t really judge Dracula Vs. Frankenstein by standard film criteria, instead you just need to sit back & enjoy the ride because I personally think this film is great fun to watch. Dracula Vs. Frankenstein quite literary has everything, it has a Frankenstein monster that looks like a speeding train has hit it\\'s face head on, Count Dracula with a silly looking beard & an afro hairstyle, who talks with a bizarre echo throughout & has plastic teeth that bulge out of his mouth, a drug addicted mute hunchback assistant, a wheelchair bound Dr. Frankenstein with a gay looking goatee beard, ancient comets, lab equipment that would look dated during 20\\'s, we do indeed see (well almost as it\\'s filmed in the horrible day-for-night process) a Dracula Vs. Frankenstein fight at the end, a biker gang & a weird guy named Strange who gets excited about playing with an old tyre in an alleyway with his girlfriend! The script is all over the place, the dialogue is insane as Dracula says things like \"your fear will fully energise the molecular structure of your blood\", or a cop that says \"if you\\'ve got a fireplace burn some wood in it, it\\'ll be a lot better than running around on the streets\" to a bemused Judith, Mike & the hippies also provide plenty of choice dialogue & lets not forget Dr. Frankenstein\\'s mumbo jumbo \"we are not butchers... we are scientists\", almost every line is an absolute classic laugh-out-loud moment & I loved all of it! Dracula & Dr. Frankenstein only meet once in the film & generally speaking Dracula & Frankenstein\\'s monster are relegated to bit-part characters as the film focuses on Dr. Frankenstein\\'s experiments & Judith\\'s investigations, which is a shame. Also, the plot is hardly logical, it makes virtually no sense whatsoever as Dracula says Dr. Frankenstein\\'s serum will help him create an army of undead Vampires & some nonsense about the human body being reanimated with a natural substance made when someone is decapitated but what does that matter when a film is this consistently entertaining? The special optical effects are terrible, check out the laser beam from Dracula\\'s ring. I thought the make-up on the Frankenstein monster was OK & it looked quite freaky. There is some gore, a couple of ripped off arms, some neck biting & a few chopped off heads. There is also one brief shot of female nudity. Technically Dracula Vs. Frankenstein is a bit of a mess, there are some awful day-for-night shots, the performances have to be seen to be believed, the music gets on the nerves after a while, the props & sets are cheap & the photography is point & hope for the best stuff. But having said all this what it basically boils down to is that I found Dracula Vs. Frankenstein just so entertaining & loads of fun, & surely that\\'s what watching films is all about? Impossible to recommend as most sane people will hate every demented second of it, but I\\'m not most people am I? I\\'ll sign off by saying I loved this film, so bad it\\'s utterly brilliant!!!',\n",

Sure! There was a pretty woman for the men to look at, a hunky guy for the ladies to look at, a decent cast, sadistic prison guards, a crazed warden, bogus science, a corrupt politician, a real electric chair, an autopsy, brain maggots, falling brains. . .my gosh. Fun galore on an evening when you've got nothing better to do. Are these my standards for great movies? No, but I didn't rent this title to see a great movie, or even a good movie.

              "  b'I can\\'t lie that I laughed during this movie, but far from how much I expected. First of all, I\\'d like to establish that even though Rodney Dangerfield has top billing--he only appears in about 20 percent of the film. And he has most of the funny lines. I liked the scene where he came out with a bandage over his pinky finger and said: \"I told my wife I hurt my little pinky. She said, \\'It\\'s OK. We\\'re not having sex tonight.\\'\"<br /><br />Kevin McDonald is the real star, and gets frightfully annoying at times. He was funny on \"Kids in the Hall,\" but he overacts way way too much in this one. You just want to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart.<br /><br />I thought there was great comic opportunity for a film that spoofs Mafia flicks. But it\\'s totally wasted with such flat gags. For example when they were spoofing the famous scene in \"Goodfellas\" where Joe Pesci gives that \"Do you think I\\'m funny?\" speech. However, the chick they used in that movie is REALLY REALLY hot. But that\\'s no compensation. If she got naked...maybe.<br /><br />\"The Godson\" definitely has its moments. But they\\'re wedged between the most brainless, flat, annoying, sometimes disgusting gags. If those gags weren\\'t torcherous and simply devoid of laughs, I might regard this movie as OK. But those gags are so tedious and mind-numbing that they drown out the few laughs that do exist--so much that I have no choice but to regard it as awful.',\n",

              "  b'Mel Brooks has brought out a couple of outrageously funny movies, and Leslie Nielson has starred in his own series, but this one measures up to neither standard, alas.<br /><br />One of the problems is that the original \"Dracula\" with Bela Lugosi was so perfect in its thingness that, after only a few viewings, it\\'s practically a self parody. In the 1930s version, Lugosi serves some drugged wine to Renfield. Renfield: \"Aren\\'t you having any?\" Dracula: \"I never drink -- wine.\" I doubt that the people involved in the production intended the line to be a joke, but that\\'s what it\\'s become. In Mel Brooks\\' version, the line is repeated and the camera holds on Leslie Nielson\\'s face, waiting for the laughs to die down.<br /><br />A second problem is that the gags vary from funny to silly, as is usual with Brooks, but there aren\\'t enough of either kind. We seem to follow the 1930s version fairly closely, almost as if it were to be taken seriously. And the jokes that pad out the scenes simply aren\\'t that amusing. In one conversation (in \"ancient Moldavian\") both Nielson and Brooks try to get the last word in. It drags on. And in the last scene of the movie, Brooks is alone with the coffin containing the now thoroughly cremated Nielson. He glances around, slyly opens the coffin an inch, and shouts in the last word of the ancient Moldavian conversation they\\'d had half an hour earlier, then slams the coffin shut and strides out with a look of satisfaction. If that\\'s the best that could be done for a climactic gag, well, there\\'s a problem.<br /><br />There are other problems. Brooks is okay in the part of Van Helsin, but Leslie Nielson is a bit old for the part of Dracula, and he doesn\\'t have the accent. (It ought to be overblown in a movie like this.) See George Hamilton do a better job with better lines in HIS Dracula parody, \"Love At First Bite\".<br /><br />It\\'s not a total waste and there are some funny moments. It\\'s just that there aren\\'t enough of them.',\n",

It's inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is, please don't make me describe it.

Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5,000, and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is. After giving Pokemon the Movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film classes?

              "  b'i have seen this film a few times but have never really been drawn to the storyline, i find the story predictable and boring, how ever i find the filming of the movie is eye catching and very cleverly done. the films major downside is that it is in french, with reading the translation below the screen you miss half of the story and the main events of the film.<br /><br />the film is about a young lady called Amelie who finds a box in her bathroom, and starts her search to return it to the rightful owner, along the way he imagination brings even the little repeated event to be blown into a huge per portion.<br /><br />with watching the film numerous times i have now picked up on the camera work and the magnificent colours, with noticing in the first time i watch Amelie the fantastic camera work and special effect which bring the film to life and help tell the story with out the translation, the camera work has defiantly made up for the storyline in Amelie and you notice something every time you watch the film.the colours also help the film and always give your eyes something to notice.<br /><br />i dislike this film but at the same time i love it, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has made up his story line with fascinating camera angles and shots which have even made the biggest movies look dull.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to other media students who would like to look at good camera work and fantastic colours but not to someone who would like a good storyline.',\n",

It begins in Budapest in the 1930\\'s and tells the (partially true) story of a restaurant owner, his girlfriend and the pianist who plays in the restaurant.<br /><br />There are so many holocaust and war stories I was not expecting this one to be different, but it certainly is. The charming characters, unpredictable events and surprise ending make this one stand out. The story takes unexpected twists and turns which kept my attention throughout the movie. I was sorry to see it end.<br /><br />I thought that using the title of the featured song, \"Gloomy Sunday\" as the title of the movie might keep some people from seeing it.

              "  b\"I saw this at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck, Michigan and it was one of my favorite short films of the festival.<br /><br />This short was great. So funny and original. It's a modern day retelling of how the Tinman lost all of his limbs, his lover, and his heart. It was wonderfully made, the acting, the cinematography, it was a really cool movie. I particularly loved the music that played throughout the film, it really added the entertainment.<br /><br />You should really check this film out. It was an award winner at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. I'll be looking out for more of director Ray Tintori's films.\",\n",
              "  b\"This was one of my favorite TV comedy series' ever, ranking with Newhart and Carol Burnett. At the time I was disappointed that the series ended after so few episodes.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I found 'Ivan the Terrible' delightful for what it was: mocking Cold War-era satire, ridiculing an obscene communist political system, played entirely for laughs.<br /><br />Of course it, like Hogan's Heroes, it was not intended to accurately depict the realities of the time and place depicted, nor their spirit. Doubtless life in Moscow was bleak, just as life in a WWII POW camp was grim. <br /><br />It has been said that the most effective means to destroy an idea is to make it into a joke and lampoon the oh-so-serious pretensions of its adherents.<br /><br />Just as the Wendy's television commercials themed on a Soviet fashion show delightfully derided the USSR's uncultured clunkiness, so did Ivan the Terrible. (The Soviet Embassy reportedly protested the Wendy's television commercials, so their sting was not lost on the oh-so-serious folks in Moscow. It wouldn't be surprising to learn of similar USSR protests against Lou Jacobi's sitcom.) <br /><br />One thing nobody has alluded to and which does not appear in that late actor's credits on the internet, is the uncredited cameo appearance at the end of each episode of Harvey Korman as a stern uniformed Soviet bureaucrat.<br /><br />The echo of unseen Carlton the Doorman from MTM's contemporary Rhoda series in the 'person' of Rasputin the dog was a nice touch, too.<br /><br />Ivan the Terrible was for me the perfect Cold War comedy. Sadly it was about the only such, unless one counts the Boris and Natasha scenes in the various Rocky and Bullwinkle animations.<br /><br />I would love to obtain tapes of the few episodes made, almost as much for Korman's walk-ons as for the rest of the show in its own right.\",\n",
              "  b\"I Thought that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a fantastic film. The year is 1974. A group of five close friends are heading through the back roads of Texas on the way to their grandfather's vandalised grave. Among them are Sally Hardesty, and her brother Franklin. They encounter an hitchhiker (Neal) who slashes both himself & Franklin with a wicked-looking knife. The others manage to get the hitchhiker out from the vehicle, but shortly afterwards, they are forced to stop & wander over to a small, sinister looking house nearby in hopes for gas. What none of them realise is that this house is the home of Leatherface and his evil, demented family of cannibalistic psychopaths. One at a time, the teens are murdered by the evil Leatherface in horrifying ways. I thought that this was a great film in the end.\",\n",
              "  b\"Having first seen the directors' 12min take on Poe's Fall of the House of Usher, I was looking forward to seeing this one too and wasn't disappointed at all. Though perhaps not quite up to the same level of artistic attainment as 'Usher' it is nevertheless very much in the same vein.<br /><br />Like the 'Usher', the viewer should be familiar beforehand with the story on which it is based. In 1928, the directors, Watson and Webber, could have safely assumed the audience's knowledge of the biblical tale. (Interestingly, apart from the actual Genesis account, a phrase from the Song of Songs is also used when Lot is offering his daughters to the mob outside, desperately trying to convince them of the attractions of 'woman'). To complain that the film does not present the plot more overtly is beside the point, and almost a declaration of ignorance.<br /><br />The basics of this tale (for those that know them) survive intact its retelling through the particularly distinctively visual, sometimes abstract or symbolic approach of Webber and Watson, and its protagonists are all clearly identifiable and well portrayed by the actors.<br /><br />On the whole, a more accessible film than the 'Usher' film from the same directors. It bears, even demands, repeated watching. My only wish is that Webber and Watson had made more than just these two films together.\",\n",
              "  b\"Nostalgic look at one night/morning of a small California town and some of its teenagers. Story-wise this is nothing new--all the stereotypes are in place--the loving/bickering couple (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams); the rebel (Paul Le Mal) stuck with a 13 year old (Mackenzie Phuillips); the nerd (Charles Martin Smith) having a disastrous date with a blonde (Candy Clark); the hood (Bo Hopkins) showing the good boy (Richard Dreyfuss) a night out and Harrison Ford and Suzanne Somers in small parts. <br /><br />What makes this movie better than average is the great direction by George Lucas--he fills the Cinemascope screen masterfully; the non-stop soundtrack of 50s/60s hits; a great script and the cast of then-unknowns. It's incredible to see some of these actors so young (especially Ford and Dreyfuss) and full of life. Without this cast, this movie would probably have long-since been forgotten.<br /><br />So, no great shakes, but very sweet and nostalgic with some good acting. Worth catching. Try to see it letter-boxed or on a big screen.\",\n",
              "  b'I thought I would give this a go, after spotting an advert for it in a well-known UK film magazine. I knew Hollow Man 2 was in production, and as a fan of the first movie I was a little non-plussed to find the sequel getting a Direct-to-DVD release.<br /><br />So I wasn\\'t really expecting much...<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find an engaging little movie - very much in the spirit of the first (no brain, no logic, full speed ahead with cardboard characters and a plot straight from the back of a 40-year-old comic). It has many faults - Christian Slater just ain\\'t up to the job any more (but seems to be enjoying himself), a long and overly-talky middle act, some extremely ropey visual effects (though it has to be said that there are many good ones despite the obviously low budget), a blatant re-use of a scene from the original Hollow Man not-very-well-disguised, and a conclusion that felt very rushed - dare I suggest the budget ran out?<br /><br />On the plus side however the 2-dimensional characters are engaging, there are one or two great jump-out-of-seat moments, tips of the hat to not only the original movie but also HG Wells\\' novel \"The Invisible Man\", effective use of music (which is all new - not a rehash of Goldsmiths original) and an overall sense of fun (That\\'s Executive Producer Paul Verhoeven shining through, I think) - despite the nasty moments!<br /><br />To the people that are slating this saying \"It\\'s not as good as the first, really disappointed\" etc etc, I simply have to wonder exactly what they were expecting! Shakespeare this ain\\'t...<br /><br />But to the people who are open-minded enough to give this an honest go, you will get out exactly what you put into it. It\\'s not Shakespeare, but it certainly is Hollow Man.<br /><br />If this is the future for the Hollow Man franchise (there is the obligatory - but well executed - set-up for a Hollow Man 3), it could be an awful, awful lot worse.<br /><br />Bring \\'em on!!',\n",
              "  b\"Aside from a couple of low budget genre films, this has to be about the worst movie I have ever seen. Here is the breakdown:<br /><br />Directing = F Prince does not know what to do with a camera. Possibly George Lucas might have been able to do a worse job directing this.<br /><br />Cinematography= B There are a number of sweet shots in this film.<br /><br />Costumes = A I want to own every outfit I saw Prince wearing this film!<br /><br />Script = F Dumb, dumb dumb. Wrecka Stow? I wouldn't have laughed at that when i was in grade school (and yes, I get it. Who could not get it?). I am just absolutely baffled by that scene. The rest is not much better. The script kills the film's ability to be funny, and its ability to draw you into the romance. <br /><br />Chemistry = B & F Prince and his sidekick have a chemistry that really works well. Given funny material, they could have really made some movie magic. A bad script pretty much sinks them, however. The chemistry between Prince and the women in the movie is nearly non-existent. The phone conversation scene was good, but that is just about it. Other than that, the romantic connection seemed awkward and forced. so B for Prince's chemistry with the male co-star, and an F for his chemistry with the 2 females.<br /><br />Acting = B Not bad acting really. All the main characters (except the older woman prince wants for her money at the beginning) do a good job. <br /><br />conclusion: Atrocious script and terrible directing sink this flick. Good acting, chemistry, and soundtrack cannot save it.\",\n",
              "  b'I love this movie! Ever since I first saw it as a kid I\\'ve counted it among my favorite W.C. Fields comedies, and when I saw it again recently it was just as funny, warm, and entertaining as ever, maybe all the more so with the passage of time. While it may not be the funniest film he ever made, THE OLD FASHIONED WAY is perhaps Fields\\' most autobiographical work, as it recreates the life of the traveling player of the early 1900s, a life he experienced personally as a vaudeville juggler. (The exact year the story takes place is never specified, but the costumes and the reference to a \"new-fangled horseless carriage\" would put it around 1905 or so.) Fields\\' early years on the road were said to be pretty rough. He and his fellow performers were forever at the mercy of unscrupulous managers, forced to live in crummy lodgings where they ate poorly, in towns where they were generally regarded as no better than tramps and whores by the disapproving townsfolk. It was not unheard of for those unscrupulous managers to abscond with the box office receipts, stranding the actors in hostile territory without a penny. Yet somehow, with the advantage of hindsight, Fields was able to turn these unhappy memories into great comedy, comedy that also serves as something of a history lesson-- albeit a pleasant one --for viewers interested in the early days of the American stage.<br /><br />Because Fields was in his mid-50s when he made this film he was able to turn the tables, in a sense: instead of reprising his real-life role as a starving young actor he\\'d graduated by this time to the role of the unscrupulous manager, known here simply as The Great McGonigle. McGonigle leads a ragtag troupe of players who are touring the hinterland in that ever-popular temperance warhorse, \"The Drunkard.\" As our story begins this troupe is fleeing a town one step ahead of the sheriff, and heading for their next engagement in the village of Bellefontaine, where prospects don\\'t look much better. In desperate need of cash, McGonigle is compelled to woo a local wealthy widow who aspires to the stage, the magnificently named Cleopatra Pepperday (played with appropriate magnificence by Jan Duggan), while in the meantime his daughter is wooed by a college boy who also dreams of performing. The boarding house where the troupe stays serves as the locale for two hilarious comic set-pieces, back-to-back: first, McGonigle\\'s lunch is ruined by Mrs. Pepperday\\'s rowdy toddler Albert, who flings food in his face, grabs his nose, and dunks his pocket watch in molasses. And then, as if he hadn\\'t been punished enough already, McGonigle must listen to Mrs. Pepperday\\'s spirited rendition of \"The Sea Shell Song.\"<br /><br />These two sequences alone are reason enough to make this movie a must-see comedy classic, and, interestingly, in each of them Fields himself plays victimized straight man: first to Baby LeRoy, then to Jan Duggan, whose rendition of the song is a show-stopping triumph. Fields\\' reactions to both of these characters are priceless, but it\\'s also worth pointing out that in this instance the notoriously paranoid, cantankerous W.C. Fields, who was said to be deeply jealous of other comedians, generously shared the spotlight with not one but two fellow players and permitted each to temporarily steal the spotlight, to the ultimate benefit of the project.<br /><br />The movie\\'s finale consists of the troupe\\'s performance of \"The Drunkard\" plus a couple of songs and, best of all, The Great McGonigle\\'s juggling act. This extended sequence feels like an authentic recreation of just what an evening at a small-town theater of the period would have been like, from the cheap-looking sets and declamatory acting styles to the heavy curtain that hits the stage with a crash after each scene. The juggling bit is a special treat, as it represents the most complete filmed record of Fields\\' legendary feats of legerdemain. My only complaint is that there are too many cut-away shots showing audience members\\' reactions; I\\'d have been perfectly happy to watch the whole routine in a couple of uninterrupted takes with no reaction shots at all. But in any event, the juggling act is wonderful.<br /><br />According to a recent biography of W.C. Fields by James Curtis THE OLD FASHIONED WAY suffered through a troubled gestation process. Just as the film was going into production Fields\\' original screenplay, entitled \"Playing the Sticks,\" was found to be somewhat jumbled and too brief to sustain a feature-length movie. Apparently the savior of the project was an unheralded screenwriter named Jack Cunningham, then known primarily for his earlier work on Westerns such as THE COVERED WAGON and a couple of Douglas Fairbanks vehicles. It was Cunningham who reworked and expanded Fields\\' original script into the seamless story it became, and who chose to interpolate the sequences from \"The Drunkard\"; he also persuaded Fields to dust off his old juggling act for the finale. If this background information is correct then viewers owe a debt of thanks to Mr. Cunningham for his important contribution to this terrifically entertaining, funny, and nostalgic slice of theatrical Americana.',\n",

Here scientists have spent the past decade attempting to master time travel. Clark is there to see whether the billion dollar project should be shut down or not.<br /><br />After being shown around a fantastic complex by Dr.Doug Phillips ( Robert Colbert ), he meets General Haywood Kirk ( Whit Bissell ), who escorts him to the Time Tunnel - an awesome two-tone vortex that seems to stretch into infinity.<br /><br />Determined to prove the Tunnel works, Dr.Tony Newman ( James Darren ) makes an unauthorised trip, materialising on the deck of a passenger steamship bound for New York. It is not any old ship either; the date is 14 April 1912, and he is aboard R.M.S. Titanic...<br /><br />The opening episode of Irwin Allen's sci-fi series begin in much the same way as the feature film of 'Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea' with V.I.P.'s being shown around a Government-funded project. The scenes where Phillips shows Clark round 'Project Tic-Toc' impress even now, with sets that look designed for the cinema ( I was reminded of the Krel complex in 'Forbidden Planet' ) rather than television. Shots of guards running across a bridge would be reused in later episodes.<br /><br />Neither Doug nor Tony have given much thought to what to do with time travel once they have perfected it. Both recklessly attempt to change the course of history by warning Captain Malcolm Smith ( a bearded Michael Rennie ) of the impending maritime disaster. The consequences for the future are not given any consideration.<br /><br />British actress Susan Hampshire plays 'Althea Hall', making her first and only trip to New York as she is suffering from a brain tumour. Tony urges her to leave in the lifeboats as there is a doctor in America who might be able to cure her. This sets up a pattern for the rest of the series; Doug and Tony are powerless to prevent major disasters, but can and do save individual lives.<br /><br />As the two scientists wear the same clothes throughout the series, its fair to assume the Tunnel must contain some sort of deodorising element, otherwise the people they meet each week would be repelled at their lack of personal freshness! <br /><br />A strong opening episode. And no sign whatever of Kate Winslet and Leonardo Decaprio!\",\n",
              "  b\"Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.\",\n",
              "  b'This movie will really give you better understanding of such terms as \"purposeless\" and \"pointless\". It\\'s simply a series of episodes, which never add up to anything.

              "  b'It didn\\'t really look that way from the previews (looked more like a whodunit) but it is. It\\'s like SPEED or THE FUGITIVE in that way and like RUN LOLA RUN in it\\'s structure. So if you like those films I\\'d say it\\'s a safe bet for you. It also has a really great car chase scene and this is coming from someone who usually doesn\\'t \"get\" those. During that whole sequence all I could think was \\'how did they choreograph that?\\' because it had to be really precise. I mean the cars were almost dancing.<br /><br />You have a stellar ensemble cast here. Forest Whitaker plays a witness to the events who gets caught up in the whirlwind. I don\\'t think I\\'ve even seen him run before so this was a little different for him. Matthew Fox and Dennis Quaid play secret service men. I was surprised how little screen time Fox had and if there is a star it\\'s Dennis. I don\\'t think it appeared that way in the trailer either. But mainly the whole thing was split up between all these different characters and their vantage points on this assassination attempt on the US president in Spain. William Hurt plays the president and I\\'m thinking I\\'m going to write him in in November. He just looks the part. Sigourney Weaver plays a TV producer who is a witness as she\\'s producing the live coverage and for a minute I thought we didn\\'t see her vantage point but her\\'s was the first one we watched. We were watching along with her and I didn\\'t realize we were already doing the multiple point of views thing. They all culminate at about the same point and once we\\'ve seen all of them the action continues from there into a perfect ending.<br /><br />This film really gets going right away and there is no time for a potty break. There isn\\'t a lot of cursing, just a couple words here or there, and not too scary violence so people who watch \"LOST\" and \"24\" level action should be able to handle it. This is the sort of movie you used to only get in the summer.',\n",

After Alone in the Dark, Christian Slater (who is barely on screen for half an hour) has become a name to definitely avoid.

Moore gives an excellent performance here, she is not over the top and quite believable as Sante.<br /><br />Robert Foster delivers a good performance as Ken \\'Pappa\\' Kimes- Sante married this man for his money, enjoyed the high life in Los Angeles, Nevada, the Bahamas and Hawaii. Apparently Sante was capable of anything. She got her husband into a political affair for Jimmy Carter\\'s election (similar in personality to John Wayne Gacy, who worked volunteered for Rosalynn Carter, and Ted Bundy, who volunteered for the Republican Governor in the state of Washington).<br /><br />Basically Sante flips when her husband does not leave her any money in his will- he leaves it to his children. This kicks in her major criminal behavior, which leads her and her son (who is her devoted slave) to New York City. She manages to get her attractive son to rent an upscale apartment owned by wealthy NYC socialite Irene Silverman, (well- portrayed by Jean Stapleton). The scenes with Stapleton and her boxer, Sophie, are truly upsetting. Silverman was murdered on 4th of July weekend, when her house-man and maid were off for vacation. I believe there was also a scene where they drove from NYC to Manalapan, Florida (The wealthiest city, near Palm Beach ).<br /><br />In court, Sante stands up and screams to the judge ...\"there is no body...so there is no case...I am innocent\".... A truly frightening movie, as it is all true. Sante and Kenny were sentenced to 220 years in prison, and presently the state of California is attempting to extradite them for their crimes in California. Highly recommended.9/10',\n",
              "  b\"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist. Then he's approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go. His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection- but they don't want him merely to capture their man- they want him taken out. All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls at Dial's feet. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him.<br /><br />This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere, with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time (I don't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere.) With this in mind and after Snipes's history of duff DVD efforts, this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it's hot. But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway. It doesn't rank among his worst, but it doesn't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all, really), either.<br /><br />This is, at best, mildly suspenseful, with a minimal of action, naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role. Likewise, in a main supporting role, it's quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their CVs.<br /><br />It says a lot that by the end the only 'contract' that's keeping you interested is when Snipes's will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films. **\",\n",
              "  b\"I saw 'New York: I Love You' today and loved it! I was really looking forward to seeing this after watching 'Paris je t'aime' and overall I think I liked this one much better... Perhaps I need to watch 'Paris je t'aime' again I don't know... I read few of the reviews here about NY:ILY and yes, the movie is not without its faults. When you're paying tribute to a city like New York - it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice... so without elaborating on any of the film's shortcomings, I'll just write about what I liked.<br /><br />Unlike 'Paris je t'aime' in which each director's short film was properly segmented and titled, NY:ILY isn't and many reviewers over here have found the seamlessness of stories and overlapping of characters here annoying and even confusing. I thought otherwise. I loved how the stories just flowed one after the other and I especially liked the overlapping of characters - it might be gimmicky because it's done so often in films now. But I still liked it because I didn't find it forced. And the idea that we're all connected in the end has a wistful, even whimsical quality to it - which some might find corny but I find beautiful.<br /><br />I liked all the films but the one that touched me the most was the one by Yvan Attal with Robin Wright Penn and Chris Cooper. It was so well-acted and scripted that the reveal in the end - again not unused in the past - brought me to tears and I was crying throughout the segment that followed. I always liked Wright Penn and now I'm also a fan of Chris Cooper. Those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant, just before he gets the call - speak volumes about Cooper's ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything.<br /><br />Most of the stories in this film involve characters who are either meeting each for the first time or have met each other just recently with the exception of 4-5 stories in which the characters have known each other for a long time. It seemed to me (and I might be wrong) that the stories were different but they were all trying to drive home the point, the need even, to just step back and view in a new light the people and the things we've known in our lives for a long time; to see the people and the things around you with the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them just as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time.<br /><br />The other films that I liked were the ones by Shunji Iwai with Orlando Bloom and Christina Ricci, by Natalie Portman with Carlos Acosta and Taylor Geare, by Brett Ratner with Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirlby, by Shekhar Kapur with Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf and John Hurt and once again the one by Yvan Attal with Ethan Hawke and Emilie Ohana when they're in the caf\\xc3\\xa9. I really need to see more work by Yvan Attal as I seem to like him a lot! <br /><br />Overall, watch this movie with an open mind. Don't read the reviews before watching it! It might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in New York should be and I doubt any movie will really live up to that conception. Just watch this movie for some good music, beautiful landscape cinematography, some slice-of-life comfort and a story or two that might just tug at your heartstrings.\",\n",
              "  b\"I really wish that the cars had hurried up and eaten Paris like 10 minutes in, so I wouldn't have to sit through this boring waste of time. The poor lighting and budget really show here and make this movie painful to watch. This movie is so devoid of any action and is so frustratingly paced that I barely made it through without fast forwarding. In fact I showed this movie to a friend with major parts fast forwarded and he didn't miss any of the plot. Watching this movie in fast forward (my 2nd viewing) shows just how many scenes were totally worthless and just add to the boredom. I have seen other Weir movies before, and understand that his pacing is really slow and doesn't follow conventional plots, but this movie was very unappealing. Picnic At Hanging Rock is a vastly superior Weir film if you are at all interested in the director. That movie creates an interesting mode and the mysterious circumstances are inticing, here there is no inticement.

As a child I was a fan of \\'60s horror films (Carradine, Cushing, et.al.) and black comedies (e.g., \"No Way to Treat a Lady\") and suspense/murder (\"Eye of the Cat\" or \"Wylie\", \"What Happened to Aunt Alice?\", \"Daddy\\'s Gone a Hunting\", \"Who Killed Teddy Bear?\"). EMr.S, at least as I remember it after 20 years, combined those genres. The title character, handsome and bi-sexual, added the homo-eroticism that made for a very happy young gay movie fan indeed. It also led me to learn that the Brits were years ahead of Hollywood in the treatment of gay characters in movies, and I now count \"Who Killed Sister George?\" and \"The Leather Boys\" as other personal favorites.',\n",
              "  b\"Maybe a bit naive to think but I thought that amateur movies like this weren't made anymore in this era- and most certainly didn't received a global release.<br /><br />The movie really surprised me how incredible amateur looking this movie was. Not only with its acting and visual style but also with its technical aspect, such as the editing, camera-positioning. Especially the editing is extremely lacking at times. It makes some sequences come across as disjointed and confusing. Also the weak camera-positioning most certainly doesn't help all of the sequences. At times the movie really looks and feels as if it was being made by a couple of high school students who decided to pick up a camera and start shooting an horror movie.<br /><br />The movie just isn't ever tense, scary or mysterious, were also lies a big problem of the movie obviously. For a genre movie it just does basically everything wrong to reach a good enough and effective end result.<br /><br />The musical score is also quite horrendous. It's a very simple typical kind of movie score, that is too prominently present at times when nothing is happening in the movie and not present at all- or not good enough at the tense or scary moments of the movie. The music has some huge misses in the movie, it could had truly enhanced some of the scare moments and tension of the movie at times.<br /><br />Of course the story also doesn't help much. The movie doesn't have the most incredible pace and story-flow. The movie also tries to be more clever than it really is, by putting in many plot twists and making things seem different than they truly are. Without doubt they also did this to make the movie original. The result however isn't much good, since it makes the movie unnecessarily difficult to follow, especially toward the end, when twists and false twists follow each other rapidly. Through the many twists the movie also starts to make less and less sense. The movie is filled with some gaping holes and the more you actually start thinking about the story, the less sense it starts to make. Not only are there many improbabilities but also many things that just plain good old fashioned plot holes, mistakes and other things that don't make much sense.<br /><br />Judging by looking at this movie Mr. Woelfel (is that even a real name?) watched a bit too many Japanese horror and John Carpenter movies. In its style it mostly tries to impersonate Japanses movies and in its story, storytelling and characters it mostly tries to impersonate John Carpenter horror movies. Nothing wrong with impersonate different styles and applying them to your own style film-making but the style just doesn't work out, mainly due to its poor budget, weak editing and story-flow. It's perhaps even a bit sad to see at times how hard they tried, without a good result.<br /><br />I had no idea who Jay Woelfel was before this but looking at his filmography he seems like a regular B-horror movie maker, who just isn't the most talented or visionary person around, no matter how hard he ever tries. He is one of those typical persons who thinks he can write, direct, produce, edit and compose all of his own movies. And does he think he is Brian De Palma, with using all those redundant and completely pointless split-screen shots that don't add anything at all? Yep, I think I'm going to watch more Woelfel movies alright.<br /><br />Yes, it's true that the movie is so bad at times that it becomes good. It's unintentionally funny at times, due to how clumsy it is made and how bad the acting and dialog are. Who ever told those persons in this movie that they could act in movies? Granted that the script with its many weak and often pointless dialog also doesn't help them much but honestly, it's obvious as well that the actors just don't have the talent for the job.<br /><br />On a positive note, the make-up effects are quite good looking. Same goes for the simplistic but effective special-effects.<br /><br />With the same story material but more money and real professionals involved this movie possibly could had been a perfectly good genre movie to watch. But not now.<br /><br />2/10\",\n",
              "  b'First off, people need to stop ranking every Kim Ki Duk movie relative to others. It\\'s not like you see a Stanley Kubrick film, and then say it is OK but is not as good as Doctor Strangelove.<br /><br />This film delves into some of the basic themes he raises in his other movies, jealousy, male desire, etc...<br /><br />The basic plot is that an old man has raised a baby girl until she is about to sexually develop, so she is now a teenager. He has raised her on his boat. He takes people out on fishing trips, needless to say the guys out on the trips take a liking to her, finally a young man comes who she seems to fancy.<br /><br />The basic question is then whether the old man will be able to prevent her from falling in love with this young guy. The name \"The Bow\" comes from a bow he uses to ward off her potential suitors.<br /><br />Think of that scene in James Dean\\'s \"Rebel Without a Cause\" where the father of Dean\\'s love interest becomes angry when she still wants to have close physical affection with him, you can tell that buried beneath he has desires for his daughter, and hence he becomes easily angry and strikes out at her.<br /><br />So this is the basic psychoanalytical insight of attraction between father and daughter and the taboo at acts to prevent it from going any further.<br /><br />There is also the age aspect. This old man still desires, but it\\'s plainly obvious that the girl is much to young for him, and that he cannot compete with younger men. So there is a love triangle, affection between daughter and father, the weakness of age, and other foundational themes.<br /><br />This movie will be a appreciated by Kim Ki Duk fans, and anyone who approaches it with an open and non-judgmental mind.',\n",
              "  b'I think a lot of people will hate this movie, because there is no a boy-loves-girl-marry-have children-happy ending story... When I saw this movie, I thought it was an European movie, I couldn\\'t believe it\\'s an American one...<br /><br />I remembered \"American Psycho\".<br /><br />I think there\\'s no \"easy\" movie to watch...<br /><br />I was horrified because the violence is very real, I live in a country with a lot of drug problems, with about 16 dead people every day (men and women and children), so everything is possible... and even me was impressed!! <br /><br />I think it\\'s a great movie... a piece of art... fine art... a psycho-thriller...<br /><br />In 50 or 60 years, when many of us were dead, someone will watch this movie and he will say: \"IT\\'S WONDERFUL... WHY PEOPLE DIDN\\'T APPRECIATE IT?\"',\n",
              "  b\"After watching Dogma for the umpteenth time on Comedy Central, I became a Linda Fiorentino fan along with others out there who wondered what happened to this promising actress since 2002. I have seen other films. This one shows that she can play a desperate housewife who can be both strong and vulnerable to her husband played by Joe Mantegna. Jamie Lee Curtis is underused in this role. Fiorentino and Chloe Webb's characters form a believable friendship on screen that I wonder why Linda hasn't worked in five years is a mystery to me. Anyway, it's an all star cast featuring besides Webb, Mantegna, and Fiorentino but also Kevin Bacon, Ken Olin, John Malkovich, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The storyline needs some work. I loved the scene where Carla steals the guys' clothes while they are skinny dipping in a pool. The movie is about a reunion of friends who get together for a wedding that may or may not happen anyway. I plead that Linda gets work soon again because she is really one of the best actresses out there playing strong women rather than weak and superficial.\",\n",
              "  b'My Take: Hilarious oddity piece with imaginative special effects and an appealing cast. <br /><br />What a weird way to make a movie! And yet, what a fun and enjoyable film it is. INNERSPACE is a highly enjoyable little film, with some fine nifty special effects and some hilarious performances by Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Martin Short. Not to mention Joe Dante\\'s wacky inventiveness in his direction makes INNERSPACE is fun film for a very fun-loving audience.<br /><br />Quaid plays Tuck Pendelton, a party animal of a scientist who volunteers to be shrunk to microscopic size and injected to the insides of a lab test rabbit. Things get awry when a rival company wrecks havoc in the lab, and one of his colleagues is forced to inject him to hypochondriac Jack Putter (Short) instead. While trying to find his way out of Putter\\'s body, Tuck changes Jack\\'s life, as he becomes his \"conscience\". On their trail is Victor Eugene Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy) and his group who wants this little science project for themselves. Then on is a combination of various chases, wackiness and secret services.<br /><br />The movie takes the plot of an old B-movie, and brings it back to life, turning it to a fun and highly-spirited sci-fi comedy. It\\'s like Richard Fleischer\\'s classic THE FANTASTIC VOYAGE, but it has its own unique ideas and storyline to set its differences. Dante keeps all in fast pace, and doesn\\'t keep us waiting for something to happen. The characters played by the leads are appealing and the script is filled with genuine laughs, with Short given the most. INNERSPACE is enjoyable entertainment, not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Rating: **** out of 5.',\n",
              "  b'First of all, the title is kind of misleading: yes, there are blondes in this movie, but they use guns approximately 1% of the running time (at the most). Unless the title refers to their others \"assets\", in which case it makes more sense. Anyway, this spoof of \"Basic Instinct\" (with such side targets as \"Indecent Proposal\", \"Body Of Evidence\" and \"9 & 1/2 Weeks\") is certainly not lazy - there\\'s a visual or verbal gag every 10 seconds or so - but, unfortunately, only a small portion of these gags score; the first 10 minutes are the best, the last 10 minutes, in particular, degenerate into sloppy idiocy. For most of the people involved, this was their first and last film; one that I would have liked to see in more is former Miss California (or so the Troma DVD cover claims) Elizabeth Key, who is not only beautiful (though the nudity is provided by the other leading lady, Gloria Lusiak), but a pretty funny comedienne as well. *1/2 out of 4.',\n",
              "  b\"Well, in a nutshell, lots of no names with a soggy plot. Who are most of these people? The drinking problem storyline is way overdone! It was a good concept, but not enough attention to who they cast in the flick. I wish the cover photo was more detailed, it just looks like a scribbled drawing from a middle schooler with issues. There was some 'would be'scary moments, but its 2008, even youtube clips are scary if the watcher is caught off guard, right? Made for t.v, maybe but a motion picture? It's mainly D list at best. (maybe E, lol)I am not a pro critic, this is just my opinion. Don't get me wrong...I love horror movies, but this movie is a horror!\",\n",
              "  b\"When I saw LUST CAUTION yesterday I wasn't sure what to think. There were moments of transcendence and many others of what, at the time, seemed like tedium. I was frustrated that I couldn't decide if this was a masterpiece right away as I was with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, THE ICE STORM, and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON. When I woke up this morning I couldn't stop thinking about it. It has haunted me all day and I want to see it again. Perhaps my expectations were so high that I had trouble appreciating what I was watching. More than likely I was anticipating the already notorious sex scenes. In any case LUST CAUTION is another masterpiece by Ang Lee that may take time for some to appreciate it. Years to come it will be studied and watched compulsively. It will strike debate among cinephiles of its worth. Most importantly it will be a film to be treasured, perhaps not by many, but by a very enlightened few.<br /><br />During the sex scenes I was holding my breath. Lee's slow burn toward these instant classic scenes was like foreplay leading to an explosive climax. Lee's themes of repression and double lives continue in LUST CAUTION. I look forward to savoring and arguing about this film for years to comes.\",\n",
              "  b'I am SURE there is some sort of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K made fun of. After seeing both this and \"Werewolf\" and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are, I became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here. Alot of people are saying that people who hate it \"are only scared by gore\", \"Don\\'t know good horror\" or stuff like that. Well, I don\\'t really care for gore, but I do want SOMETHING to happen in a movie! Most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around! Or walking around the house/garden! A movie requires something to give it atmosphoere, you don\\'t get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares. Oh, and \"Makes you think\"? Yeah, I was thinking \"MOVE! YOU @#$0&%!!\" One of the worst horror movie I have ever scene! <br /><br />P.s. For the record, I am a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, That kind of stuff.',\n",
              "  b'Here\\'s the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly, it\\'s for two reasons. One, it concentrates of young people, VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and \"The Man in the Moon\" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens, it\\'s the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />The cast of \"The Man in the Moon\" is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she\\'s going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way.',\n",
              "  b'There is not much to say about this except to warn other people not to waste their money on it. The story-telling and the directing was so obnoxious. It was a total no-brainer. A duh..movie that only hit my vagal nerve and made me nauseous. There is a long time since I have walked out of a movie but this one made it. Better luck to the actors and producers next time.',\n",
              "  b'Hm well. I\\'m a big fan of Mankell. I\\'ve read most of his books and seen the movies. I haven\\'t read \"Innan Frosten\" thou but I cant believe its as bad as this movie. It was utterly crap. No depth, no characters, no plot, no dialog and the actors, my God, are they really pros? That S\\xc3\\xa4llstr\\xc3\\xb6m girl, shes not in my book, but some regard her as quite an actress but this?! Please give me a break. The directors willingness to shoot her mostly from behind dressed in her tight jeans, I am sad to say, saved this movie from getting a 2 from me. Now I just have to read the book so I can determine if its as bad as the movie. People, save yourself from wasting a good hour and a half, do something else, sew, make pottery I don\\'t care, just leave this be.',\n",

Completely wrong.<br /><br />Well, no, not completely; it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick, they were right about that. But it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well.<br /><br />Tom Beringer wasn't too bad, I suppose, no worse than usual; but what possessed them to cast Billy Zane in this? Was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers? A way to made their film a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked.<br /><br />If they were actually aiming for success, then why not cast somebody who can act? Oh, and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct.<br /><br />As someone who sat through this mess, actually believing it would shortly redeem itself, I can assure you it never did. Pity, it could've been a good film.\",\n",
              "  b\"...that a human mind is capable of creating such intriguing plot - so terrifying and captivating this movie is. Frank Capello is obviously a man of genius. But he is not nice and gentle to his audience. The movie is sharp-straight, honest and pretty cruel to a person watching it. It doesn't compromise. Don't expect it to comply with general drama movie rules. <br /><br />*** BE AWARE OF SPOILERS BELOW ***<br /><br />After you ve seen 50% of it or so you think it's pretty common drama, quite predictable and possibly happily ending one. Well, its not. Not at all. And so shockingly not.<br /><br />Cast is perfect. I would never think Slater could fit into the role of Bob. W.Macy would fit better, I thought. But these thoughts faded away.<br /><br />The movie is not open-ended despite what some people say. You just have to think harder than you usually do while watching a regular movie. Be more attentive or watch it again.<br /><br />Capello makes you think. If you want to know what really happened analyze the details. There are answers.<br /><br />I give 9 out of 10, because Capello rudely and savagely ruined my hopes for the better ending :)\",\n",
              "  b'Well, I\\'ve never seen a Huffy outrace a muscle car... but I guess when you are making a completely irrational film it is certain to happen somewhere along the line. I think you can count the lines of dialogue in the first thirty minutes on two hands. I guess the director\\'s rationale was that it\\'s better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid, than to open it and remove all doubt. Then again I think assuming there was any rationale involved in the production this movie is giving the director too much credit.<br /><br />This film has some of the most hilarious chase scenes I have ever seen. First you have Troy\\'s epic escape from machete wielding villains via his mountain bike. I swear this scene would not end. Literally ten minutes are spent tracking Troy as he eludes a car full of goons on his Huffy. Eventually the heroes give up chasing this kid in a car and decide to foot it. Sadly enough, they come closer to catching him on foot than they did when they chased him with their car. Finally, when it seems as though these villains are about to catch Troy, he hops into the back of a truck. This is no ordinary truck, however. This is a truck owned by the dumb, drunken protagonist Zap Rowsdower... yes, Zap Rowsdower. This guy is a cross between John Candy and Joe Dirt. I think that I could use my ass cheeks as a face and be a more effective actor than this guy. Anyway, after Zap and Troy reach a gas station another hilarious chase scene ensues. Of course Zap and Troy have the last laugh. The funniest part about this scene is when the villains car treads off of a hill and takes a long winded drive towards a creek. The scene could have easily been ended by just blowing up the car, or by the villains simply hitting the brakes but NO. For dramatic effect the director had the villains speed across a 500 feet straightaway into a creek.<br /><br />The chase scenes are all good and fun, but the supporting cast is what makes this movie so \"fun\" to watch. ESPECIALLY the character Mike Pipper. This character is a hybrid - one part Macho Man Randy Savage, one part Ted Kaczynski. I was just waiting for him to shout out \"Ooooh Yea!!!\" after every single line. And let us not forget the performance of \"Satoris\", the antagonist of the film. Satoris, as we learn, is hell- bent on taking over the world. He plans on achieving this by sacrificing our virginal protagonist, Troy. Unfortunately he doesn\\'t succeed. After a bunch of useless scenes, horrible acting, and utterly retarded dialogue the \"climax\" is reached when Troy kills Satoris and in doing so saves the world from the necessity to continue this horrible film.',\n",
              "  b\"Embarrassingly, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that any father or brother can relate to... one brother is a bit 'wild,' the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly cast as the father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The movie closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format. Unlike most book to movie stories, this one measures up. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.\",\n",
              "  b\"How can you not love a film where the invitations to the South African premiere were printed on barf bags? Especially when it has a pitch as insane as The Manitou, which sees Susan Strasberg growing the foetus of a 400-year-old reincarnated Native American medicine man in her neck and calling on Tony Curtis' psychic for help. Of course, Curtis being a phony he seeks help himself, first from Stella Stevens' gypsy and then, deciding to fight fire with fire, Michael Ansara's medicine man. Ansara gives a surprisingly good performance considering the material, but even his Indian magic isn't enough to fend off an evil Felix Silla from summoning the Devil himself, who can only be defeated by turning on every computer in the hospital at the same time and Susan Strasberg getting her tits out in a vaguely New Age Meets 2001 finale. Despite the synopsis, unintentional laughs are in short supply, although a sequence where one of Curtis' elderly customers is possessed, floats down the hallway and throws herself down the stairs is a mini-masterclass in ineptitude as it fluctuates between failed attempts at humour and laughable attempts at drama. Still, any film where the co-writer is blown up on screen and where a frozen nurse is accidentally decapitated isn't entirely without some merit.\",\n",

I seriously think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.

              "  b\"This movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. What strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. Besides following the play like a TV broadcast, there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games. This brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory. Today's TV broadcasting style, so different than that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.<br /><br />The players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history. In this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In that regard, today's TV broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before.<br /><br />There are several highlighted players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague#o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil), and Sanchez (Mexico).<br /><br />This movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of Mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. Across all the movie, there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves. This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.<br /><br />Because of what happened because of referees during Mexico 1986, much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely Maradona-biased. Much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen, that they are as human as the players, and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other. Soccer rules do not allow referees to use TV based replays to make decisions, so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive. As a consequence, referees play an active part in the development of a game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie.<br /><br />The sequel movie for the 1990 World Cup, compared to this one, is just a source of bitter disappointment. Much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game, whereas this movie tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.\",\n",
              "  b\"My favorite movie genre is the western, it's really the only movie genre that is of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them quite like Americans.<br /><br />Right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from Universal. Many such deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.<br /><br />Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures, noir type stuff with no real budgets. Just before Winchester 73 Mann had done a fine western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, that never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided Mann was the person he decided to partner with.<br /><br />In this film Mann also developed a mini stock company the way John Ford was legendary for. Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why I won't say, but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen. Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have.<br /><br />The hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film. After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns aren't carried in Earp's Dodge City. There's a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Dutch Henry Brown, played with menace by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there. Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialog.<br /><br />Another character Stewart runs into in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film. This may have been Duryea's finest moment on screen. He's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns. <br /><br />Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters who's fianc\\xc3\\xa9 is goaded into a showdown by Duryea and killed. Her best scenes are with Duryea who's taken a fancy to her. She plays for time until she can safely get away from him. Guess who she ultimately winds up with?<br /><br />There are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there ain't a sour note in the cast. John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, best known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief, but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times.<br /><br />Mann and Stewart did eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to do a sixth western, Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann walked off the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.\",\n",
              "  b'In this film each unhappy family is, to a greater or lesser extent, the architect of its own demise.Many people have criticised the film for not saying much, or for being overloaded with story lines; for not following through or following through too explicitly. All in all it clearly confuses and divides people. I think there is a problem and it is not the movie that has the problem but the audience.This story touches on some of the last taboos in cinema namely the actual visualisation of homosexual sex, and even worse in the eyes of the beholders it addresses incest. The cross cultures/cross races thing seems to me to be a side issue to the main problem illustrated here which is that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way to quote Tolstoy (apt here as Shawn the black homosexual is reading \"Anna Karenina\" at one point in the action, and like Anna unable to come to terms with himself and the world in which he lives, eventually commits suicide.)The film comes originally from a stage play set in Glasgow. Some of the dialogue has been lifted straight from the play and so can sound a little stilted, but in my opinion this device helps to maintain the necessary distance between the action and the audience. This plainly is an allegorical piece, each actor fulfils a function rather than a character but the story is none the worse for that; many art house movies do likewise. It is the subject matter here that is so difficult. As for the actual movie, it looks good, in fact is amazing considering it was shot in 20 days in New York masquerading as Chicago (I assume to keep the costs down). The acting by the whole ensemble is excellent. And I think one has to give Anthony LaPaglia especial praise as the Architect in question clearly in the grip of an incestuous passion. This cannot be an easy kind of role for any actor to play, but, as one has come to expect of Mr LaPaglia, he carries it off to perfection which may go a long way to explain the uncomfortableness felt by some moviegoers. Within his oeuvre this film seems almost like a companion piece to the more hopeful \"Winter Solstice\". My advice to anyone wishing to see \"The Architect\" would be to go along with an open mind, expect to be challenged and perhaps you\\'ll come away with the same feelings as me, that this is a good film, a thought-provoking film but not one to watch just for the pure fun of it, go and see Mr LaPaglia\\'s other current film \"Happy Feet\" if you want that!',\n",
              "  b\"Douglas Fairbanks Sr. stars in this exciting, action-packed swashbuckling pirate adventure yarn, as a young man seeking revenge on a band of pirates after they ransacked and destroyed his ship, killing his father. In trying to achieve his goal, he tricks the pirates into thinking he wants to join their band. Will this ruse work?<br /><br />This delivers all the thrills and cutthroat pirate action anyone could ever hope for and even more. It has all the elements one looks for and wants from today's big blockbusters: impressive stunts mostly performed by Fairbanks himself, sword fights, pirate treachery, explosions, daring underwater scenes, a damsel in distress, the works. There's a few plot holes and questionable plot twists here and there but it all holds up incredibly well after all these years although in today's world lead actress Billie Dove would have been given more to do. That's a minor nitpick at best. If you like pirate yarns, check this out. Believe me, they just don't get much better than this.\",\n",

If you have nothing else to do and there is nothing else on TV and you don't have to clean or clip your toe nails and if there is no paint pealing off the walls you can watch, and or you are a Jovovich fan, give it a shot but its really just not that good.

Instead of just making the Americans out to be bad guys, the Japanese people in the children's village either through greed (their aunt) or through indifference (Gardener, Doctor), also play their part in the children's starvation and death.

              "  b'Takva - A Man\\'s Fear of God is one of those films that playfully enact conflicts of fundamental importance for the world we live in. Takva starts off with humble Muharrem, an introverted single man living in Istanbul, being drawn into the inner circle of a Muslim brotherhood he has adhered to ever since his childhood days. When the erudite and strikingly pragmatic leader, Sheikh Cemal, appoints him as his financial organizer, Muharrem gets endowed with all the amenities and trappings of a modern world businessman. He has to collect rent and administer the order\\'s finances. His naive will to live a life according to what he thinks is the will of God clashes not only with his unfulfilled sexual desires, but also with the mechanisms of power within the order. The brothers\\' lifestyle may be conservative, but they run an organization that is fully intertwined with the present day social, political and economic life of Turkey. <br /><br />For Muharrem, who hardly understands any of this business, this means that every step he intends to make for the greater glory of God draws him ever deeper into the quagmire of corruption, lies and hypocrisy. The authority he is endowed with now makes him haughty and difficult to deal with, while his accumulated frustration increasingly throws him into literal fits. Everything escalates when he comes face to face with the woman he desires... <br /><br />The plot for this great film is based on an old folk tale from Turkey about a man who refuses to marry the daughter of his spiritual master although he clearly loves her. In Onder Cakar and Omer Kiziltan\\'s adaptation, the narrative serves to expose the inner mechanisms of puritan Muslim orders and throw light on the mental set-up of its loyal members. The film is pure fun to watch due to countless instances of great irony, a remarkable love for detail and breathtaking scenes of ecstatic rituals. While the filmmakers were very careful not to ridicule the milieu they\\'re depicting, their critical approach accounts for a film that substantially helps understand the way political Islam \"works\".',\n",

In less capable hands, that world could have been flat and lifeless on screen. Not so here. The every day life of friends is shown as raucous, witty, poignant, and as painful as we know real life to be.<br /><br />The cast embraced the characters, obviously having a good time bringing them to life. You like these people and root for them until the end of the film. Clea DuVall has the pivotal scene in the movie, and is flawless as she takes you through Jen's search for love despite her insecurity. Jensen Ackles' performance makes sure you'll never look at tampon commercials the same way ever again. And special kudos to Alice Krige, who doesn't have a lot of screen time, but her Zo is memorable.<br /><br />I've read some criticisms about the sex in the film; it's definitely in-your-face stark, but I don't think it was out of line for the storyline of the characters involved.<br /><br />The soundtrack was dead-on, complimenting the timing of the story with just the right mood and expanding the aura of the characters as they cruise through the film.<br /><br />Bottom line - I laughed, I cried. Then I laughed again, while I was crying. Any film that can take me through that in 98 minutes gets my over-35 vote of confidence.\",\n",

As you expect with Takeshi Kitano, its both mesmerizing and infuriating, always teetering on a tightrope with brilliance on one side and hopeless pretentiousness on the other.<br /><br />Its so difficult to penetrate a movie like this - it is slow, but carefully paced, with a peculiar editing pattern. Scenes are held for a few seconds more than most directors would hold, catching characters staring blankly at the aftermath of an action. Events occur with little or no warning or apparent reason. Characters are mostly blanks - either husks of men, or just empty psychopaths, its hard to say. The climax is shown obliquely, from a distance, we can only infer what is happening later.<br /><br />So, to put it mildly, this is not your average gangster movie. In some ways, it has suffered with the passage of time - we are now spoiled with such complex portrayals of gangsters such as in the Sopranos, we find it hard to accept Kitano's almost noble portrayal of what are in reality brutal, selfish sociopaths. Perhaps its the Japanese concept of people being pulled along by the tides of life, rather than actors in our own destinies that is the real theme of this and his other movies. But is this the excuse for the hero being a callous killer? We find ourselves sympathizing with his increasingly rotten soul, rather than empathizing with his victims.<br /><br />Love him or hate him, Kitano is one of the most interesting film makers in the world today, and Sonatine is one of his best - just expect to be scratching your head in puzzlement at the end.\",\n",

I can very well imagine how this movie gets five stars in women's magazines and trendy periodicals.<br /><br />So, if goofy shallowness turns you on, this is your movie, but if you have any respect for yourself and movies with actual content, there are a whole better films to see.\",\n",

I have done a huge number of reviews and am constantly noticing that even the most mediocre films get scores of 10 from some reviewers. While this is definitely a better than average film, no sane person could say it deserves a score akin to that of GONE WITH THE WIND or THE GODFATHER.

Just my two cents worth and I\\'m sure I\\'ll catch heck for saying it.<br /><br />As for this movie, it\\'s a nice little family film that benefits from being very unique and having several wonderful performances. In this slice of pioneer life film, William Holden and his son are left alone after the death of his wife. Needing a mother for the boy and someone to help out around their frontier homestead, he travels to the nearby fort to find a wife. There, he buys an indentured servant (Loretta Young) and brings her back home after marrying her. Not exactly a romance, I know! Unfortunately, there never really is any romance, as Holden and son treat her more like a hired hand and after a while it\\'s obvious she resents this--especially after she works herself to the bone caring for them. Into this very unhappy situation comes \"the stranger\" (Robert Mitchum)--who immediately realizes the problem and proposes to take Rachel away from this drudgery--and pay Holden for her! While there is a lot more to the film, this certainly made for an unusual flick.<br /><br />The performances all around are excellent and the film ended on a very good and not especially sappy note. Well worth your time and I have no serious complaints--other than the writer who indicated that Miss Young was playing a lady who was 25 (yeah, right!!). In actuality she was a decade older and she wasn\\'t fooling anyone--but still a lovely woman regardless of the age difference.',\n",

I figured before the movie started Michael Douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses, and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist. But I thought thats where the political statement would begin and end.<br /><br />OK, the plot was solid: Single president falls for a lobbyist. OK, this has potential I thought to be pretty entertaining, since the plot was unique. But then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial. The movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the President and Sydney(Annette Bening).<br /><br />There were several ridiculous premises in this movie: 1) The character Sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a \"closer\". Could she have been more flighty? She was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything. Hardly a \"closer\". I am an sales, and she could not \"close\" selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst.<br /><br />2) Secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible.<br /><br />3) The speech at the end was simply ludicrous. The line about \"I am a proud card carrying member of the ACLU\" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit something like that, being an active member of an ultra fringe group. Second, why even bring something like that up. You just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative.<br /><br />I thought the plot was great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the movie went from being a \"movie\" to a left wing political statement, which is why the movie failed.<br /><br />Its a shame to see a great plot ruined by Hollywood having to force their political views on the audience',\n",

              "  b\"Adam Sandler is rapidly becoming my favourite on-screen comedian. He has this knack of doing incredibly stupid films that nevertheless manage to put a big stupid grin on my face for the whole show. This one has all the Sandler trademarks: a daft plot, a pervading sense of (mostly) innocent fun, incredibly funny supporting cast, plenty of cameos, cartoon-like laws of physics, references to his other films (or is that vice-versa in this case?). His characters tend to start out unlikeable (such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison), but the viewer ends up rooting for them anyway as the film progresses and the character's good side is revealed. There is usually a positive, inclusive feeling to the comedy style: just about all the characters in the film (even the sleaze-bags) are treated well by Sandler's character (once he gets over his temper tantrums in this case), which puts these films head and shoulders above the derisive, divisive style of humour that seems so common elsewhere these days. Sandler's characters tend to only make headway when they are being good, which isn't a bad message for the kids in the audience. Yet there's nothing saccharine or Disney-esquire here. While some gags are a bit predictable, there are still plenty of surprises and some outright lunacy that keep it fresh.

I can re-watch his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and I never get tired of them.<br /><br />My first impression of this film was \"What is this...?\" (bits of different videos, some drawn images, unsettling jumps from one theme to another, absence of any cohesive plot line, some kids fooling around, etc.) but as I watched it till the end, I could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on TV nowadays. What I like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily.<br /><br />Without Mr Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality. He knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles.<br /><br />When I see a proper DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. \"HIStory I\", \"HIStory II\", and \"Moonwalker\" are all great, though only \"Moonwalker\" is more like one movie (with a solid \"Smooth Criminal\" theme, \"paparazzi\" topic, and a few weird spoofs and twists).<br /><br />Being no fan of MJ I can still give this \"film... like no other\" a solid 9 out of 10 (I\\'ve been hit by \"Smooth Criminal\" for sure and my major complains are the following: initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main \"MJ anti-drug campaign\" should have been given more \"sky-rocketing insanity and stress\" and there should have been more \"moonwalking\" itself of course). Thanks for attention.',\n",
              "  b'Considering that I love sci-fi and horror films from the 1950s, it is very surprising that I rate this film as low as I do.

When they descend into them, they are captured by the subterranean people. Because they have lived under ground since ancient times and are look much like albinos, as it turns out their civilization was swallowed into the earth along with them.<br /><br />At first, everything seems just peachy, but later these underground people turn out to be major jerks who keep incredibly ugly creatures as slaves.

Other movies that come to mind are the recent precious and the ribald Monster's Ball. They pretend to loath the ugliness of the reality they present but in actual fact revel in it. This movie is just such an example of worthy bourgeois film making passing itself off as insightful and profound.

It is also somewhat boring too, as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such. The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that. The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course Summers attack scene too. What else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through. In the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants.',\n",

A number of people seem to have picked up on this aspect of the movie and thus dubbed it similar to Pulp Fiction (though no one mentions Reservoir Dogs) when this movie takes non-linear storytelling to a level beyond where Quentin Tarrantino was ever able to go.<br /><br />Now, certainly Memento came along afterwards and transformed the entire art of non-linear storytelling. However, Memento uses it to keep the movie watcher guessing until the very end, whereas Boondock Saints puts the pieces on the table, letting you try to put them together, but then will continue handing you pieces until the picture becomes clearer.<br /><br />Clearly the movie is designed to be over-the-top, both from Williem Dafoe\\'s character to the action sequences themselves. Williem Dafoe makes this movie for me. The plot, which centers on religiously-inspired vigilante justice, has an air of being somewhat cliched, although I would be hard pressed to name another movie which handles it in this matter.<br /><br />I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning, when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear. I thought the ending, in which various people are interviewed about their opinion of the \"Saints\" and how for some vigilante justice was an incredibly sensitive issue, made this point very clear.',\n",

The first one is the only one worth watching though which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____(insert unknown actor here, he\\'s obviously done nothing else worth noting) in a seedy, disgusting Motel room (the kind with the busted sink that drips, and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it).

              "  b'By 1932, the California Tiffany studios had been hard-hit by the depression\\'s increasing damper on the motion picture industry, and had most recently been taken over by the troika of Burt Kelly, Sam Bischoff and William Saal, producing under the achronym K.B.S.<br /><br />One of the talented individuals attracted to K.B.S. during this turbulent period was Robert Florey, who had directed THE COCOANUTS, in which the Marx Brothers made their film debut, and co-authored the script of FRANKENSTEIN, then adapting and directing MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.<br /><br />A STUDY IN SCARLET was Florey\\'s third project at Tiffany, and he was again scheduled to both write and direct--his preferred mode of working. While producer Bischoff had purchased the motion picture rights to the title of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s novel for only a small sum, Florey was told to compose a new scenario to co-star Anna May Wong opposite Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />A cause for the alteration of the original plot is that producers may have felt the title exceeded the worth of the actual story. Conan Doyle\\'s original, written in 1887, was a vehicle for a denunciation of the contemporary Mormon practice of polygamy, which for American movie makers may have aroused concerns of censorship and regional distribution difficulties--just the type of difficulty a small, independent company like K.B.S. could not afford to risk. As well, half the narrative consisted of a lengthy confession, with Holmes only present in the prelude, which would have surely disappointed most filmgoers. While A Study in Scarlet was the first Holmes mystery Conan Doyle wrote, it had been filmed only twice before, with an English feature and an American short both appearing in 1914. Not until 1968 was the subject tackled again, this time by the BBC in a fifty-minute television presentation.<br /><br />Given a week to come up with a narrative to fit the picture\\'s title and Wong\\'s presence, Florey collaborated with his friend Reginald Owen, who had been chosen to portray Holmes, and split the $1,000 script payment. They collaborated on the continuity in consultation with Art Director Ralph DeLacy in order to utilize as many standing sets as possible, economies always being especially important at a studio like Tiffany, even on as significant a project as A STUDY IN SCARLET.<br /><br />At this point Florey left, having received the offer of a long-term contract from Warner Bros. on condition that he leave immediately to direct their comedic mystery GIRL MISSING. Bischoff allowed Florey to leave, with both agreeing that his replacement as director on A STUDY IN SCARLET should be Edwin L. Marin. Marin, age 33, previously had helmed only one movie on his own, a low budget item entitled THE DEATH KISS (1932). At K.B.S. he had just finished assisting Florey on THE MAN CALLED BACK and THOSE WE LOVE, \"waiting for such a break.\"<br /><br />Although the Florey-Owen script contained no similarities to the novel, their plot did demonstrate a familiarity with the world Conan Doyle created for Sherlock Holmes. Elements are present from other Holmes stories, especially The Sign of Four, \"The Red-Headed League\" and \"The Five Orange Pips.\" There are many of the typical clues, devices, and mannerisms.<br /><br />The title is incorporated to refer to a very exclusive organization called \"the Scarlet Ring,\" a group of eccentric and highly ambiguous characters so suspicious of one another that they are afraid to even walk together. Upon the death of any member, his property is divided among the remaining survivors; suddenly they begin to die at an alarming pace under strange circumstances. This group of individuals were personified by an unusual group of actors, including J.M. Kerrigan, Halliwell Hobbes, Wyndham Standing, Tetsu Komai, and Cecil Reynolds.<br /><br />Some critics have pointed out the movie\\'s similarity to And Then There Were None / Ten Little Indians, with suspects killed one by one and their murder announced by a nursery rhyme. But if anything, the influence was the other way around, since Agatha Christie\\'s novel was not published until 1939.<br /><br />The script of A STUDY IN SCARLET was extremely polished and well-constructed, developing at just the right pace while carefully building the appropriate mood and environment. The movie breathes life into the classically eerie atmosphere of the British mystery, creating a pervasive feeling of fear in the fog-bound studio streets of the Limehouse section of London. Strange gatherings, arranged by secret codes, take place in abandoned, out-of-the-way buildings; dark and oppressive dead-end streets are places of isolation and terror; fog and shadows hide murderers and their victims.<br /><br />Suspense is heightened by a number of devices. For instance, the killer is kept unseen, while at the same time menace is suggested by having the crimes viewed through the murderer\\'s eyes using a subjective camera. The silhouette of a giant shadow appears on a wall as the victim stares at the audience and screams \"It can\\'t be you,\" followed by a close-up of a hand checking off the name of one more member of the Scarlet Ring who has been killed. The climax of this technique comes in a long-take with the still-unknown murderer visiting the crooked lawyer played by Alan Dinehart: the camera completely adopts the viewpoint of the killer as Dinehart opens the door and the unknown individual is offered a cigarette, puffs of smoke ascending in front of the lens.<br /><br />The sense of locale was enhanced by the use of a nearly all-British cast, something unusual for a Hollywood-made Sherlock Holmes picture. Reginald Owen in particular was given the necessary latitude to offer a different interpretation of the Holmes personality. Owen portrays a much more human, less remote man, more akin to the personification offered by William Gillette in his stage play, to whom Owen even bore a certain physical resemblance.<br /><br />By the time A STUDY IN SCARLET was released, in mid-1933, K.B.S. and World-Wide had folded, with Fox handling the distribution. The picture opened to an excellent critical reception.',\n",

There are also a few chunks of angst thrown in, and one painfully melodramatic reminiscence scene which might have worked if we cared more about the characters. The music is too loud, and the 'twist' at the ending was obvious about five minutes in.<br /><br />On the plus side, the women are easy on the eye, most of the performances are pretty good, and there are some genuinely funny moments in the last half of the film.

It would be tricky to do - they are often about completely different people from the three in the boat, but they are what make the book so good, and they've simply been discarded in the film.<br /><br />So, in summary, if you've never read the book, you're in for a nice surprise: comedy that is still funny after a hundred years and more, but don't let this film put you off.\",\n",

Gatlif does not spell anything out for you. He leaves it up to you to try to put the pieces together, and he knows that there are certain types of people, with a certain awareness, who will be attracted to his films.<br /><br />I thought Vengo was incredibly deep with so much true emotion and so much of the subtle and misunderstood inner-struggles of the people of Andalucia being depicted through a number of overlapping stories and characters: The retarded nephew, the man whose daughter had died, the feuding Gypsy families, the exiled father of the son living in Morrocco, etc.<br /><br />This movie told the tale of a people and their will to hold on to the purest (\"Flamenco Puro!\") sources of happiness and joy within their lives, amidst circumstances which seemed destined to tear them a part and undermine their unity.<br /><br />An incredibly beautiful story with lots of information, emotion, and spirit.

              "  b'There has been way to much chatter about how beautiful this film is with its sumptuous sets, costumes, and magnificent photography. On the surface this looks like another gangster film, this time taking place in Shanghai. But of course, it isn\\'t. The gangster scenario is just the backdrop really. <br /><br /> Shuisheng, a boy of 14, has come to the city to serve the haughty and beautiful Xiao Jingbao, the nightclub singing moll of Tang, head of the most powerful gang in Shanghai. <br /><br /> Shuisheng\\'s uncle is a riot as he gives the boy a whacky set of instructions on how to be a proper servant to snobby Xiao, wonderfully played by Gong Li. \"Call her \\'Miss\\'. Follow her wherever she goes, not to far behind, and not to close. That\\'s the rule. Hold her coat in your left hand and her hat in the right, but don\\'t let the coat drag on the floor. That\\'s the rule. Got it?\" And the Shuisheng replies, \"Got it.\" However, after \"Miss\" delights in calling him a country bumpkin, and chews him out a couple of times, (And why not, Shuisheng can\\'t tell a red dress from a green one.) the kid starts looking for the exit. When his uncle tells him, \"When she rings for you, stop everything (yes, everything) and go to her. Got it?\" His reply this time is, \"I want to leave.\" Bad move, uncle is most displeased. <br /><br /> In many ways, Shuisheng is the most inscrutable character in the movie. He\\'s got a real poker face, and you\\'ll probably have a tough time deciding if he\\'s an idiot, or a sharp kid who\\'s observing things closely and learning fast. This is the heart of the film, the relationship between the boy and the woman. Eventually, the boy will find out the self-important, hip swinging Xiao Jingbao is miserable. She is the beautiful songbird hopelessly trapped in a world where she is bathed in luxury by the ruthless Tang, with no hope of freedom. <br /><br /> The boy\\'s whole attitude changes when he realizes this, and the question the film poses from here is ... what, if anything, can he do about it? If this was an American film, (and I\\'d love to see such a version) probably plenty, but director Yimou Zhang is a cynical man with a dark outlook on life. All his films have downbeat endings, and this one is no exception. What really bothers me though, is that events take place that result in a complete shift in setting half way through the film, and that\\'s always a dangerous move in the cinema. And this abrupt shift comes at a time when things are just getting interesting in the nightclub, when Shuisheng realizes \"Miss\" is very unhappy. He might have been able to help her in the big city and spacious confines of the nightclub, but marooned on an island, there\\'s not much he can do. This is a good film, but I would have liked to see the plot move in a different direction in the second half.',\n",

If you'll remember he was abandoned on deserted asteroid. The Fury deals with a young man on the way to being another Gary Lockwood.<br /><br />Young Andrew Stevens has those abilities already, they just need to be focused and developed. Stevens is being raised by his widowed father Kirk Douglas who's a government agent. A raid while they're on vacation in the Mediterranean by some Arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by John Cassavetes to separate father from son. Stevens believes Dad has died, but Kirk doesn't swallow that so easy.<br /><br />Kirk's on the hunt for his son and the quest takes him to Chicago where people like Stevens with paranormal abilities are being studied and tested so the USA can have them as a weapon.

And so is Fiona Lewis who's been given personal charge of Stevens and develops the kid's libido as well as his telekinesis.<br /><br />Brian DePalma directed this film and it's a good one with outstanding performances by all the cast.

DiMarsico) -- go to a rundown and abandoned old building for a photo shoot. Of course, said building turns out to be haunted by vicious and depraved sadist Rossiter (a deliciously hammy turn by Kevin G. Shinnick). While the premise certainly has promise, alas said promise is severely undermined by writer/director Brett Piper's lackluster execution: the sluggish pace crawls along for the first two thirds of the picture, there's no spooky atmosphere to speak of, the special effects are strictly so-so, and the drab and uneventful script gets bogged down in a dull surplus of insipid talk. Only when Rossiter gets revived in the last third and begins brutally torturing the ladies does this flick finally start cooking, but by then it's too little too late to alleviate the general tedium. The cast do their best with the blah material, both Jon Greathouse's moody score and M.A. Morales' polished cinematography are up to speed, and there's a decent smattering of yummy female nudity (Misty in particular as usual looks quite scrumptious in her birthday suit), but overall this movie is too poky and plodding.

              "  b\"I found it hard to like anyone in this film. The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better. But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their life's tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions. It's not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it's merely an account of a true story that happened there. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.<br /><br />When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one's life. The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.<br /><br />The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers. To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter. Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press? How much of the downward spiral could've been prevented had she behaved more to the public's liking in the media? Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of film-making. But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy. What is infuriating is that it's not that difficult. Apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case. Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.<br /><br />Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophie's Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph. It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself. She frustrates us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling. It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her, but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the public's attention.<br /><br />She is married to a pastor, and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most. Initially, they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to God's will, kick-starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part. Whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify, so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well...<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen, but the Australian public plays the real leads here. Like punctuation for each plot advance, director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.<br /><br />This Golan-Globus docudrama is not particularly memorable. The setting's atmosphere doesn't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out. But it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public.\",\n",

It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve seen this movie, but I do remember how bad it was. Not funny, no plot, just a complete waste of time. The movie budget was probably about $17.00. Eddie Deezen is always a good comic relief in most movies he\\'s in and I do remember Linda Kerridge was nice eye candy during her 15 minutes of fame, but I would rather have my fingernails pulled out than have to sit thru viewing Surf II again.

Forced dialogue all through the movie, plus I felt the director had been playing with as many different camera techniques as he could think of - ending up making a big mess of waste. Such disappointment..<br /><br />The only potential bit was the scene where he was taking a bath, getting a mental image of the bodybuilder type she described on the phone..

She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />So many clich\\xc3\\xa9s came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments.',\n",
              "  b\"I had no expectations for this movie before I saw it, expect a high regard for Gary Cooper and director King Vidor, and neither disappointed me in this nice effort from them.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this story concerns married writer Gary Cooper --one not unlike F. Scott Fitzgerald -- who has lost his groove, and had his latest novel rejected by his publisher. He is forced to give up his Manhattan apartment and move back to the abandoned family homestead in Connecticut. There he meets a community of Polish immigrants, and slowly falls in love with beautiful young Polish girl Anna Sten, who he had hired to help around the house.<br /><br />My first thought about this movie as I watched it, was that the leading man was more beautiful than the leading lady, as Gary Cooper certainly looked fabulous and was photographed with great sensitivity. Cooper in his modern American clothes certainly had the upper hand over Sten, who was always wearing dowdy traditional Eastern European dresses and hats. She was almost completely covered up in these costumes for the duration, and it would have been a treat to see her in American garb.<br /><br />The speed that Cooper's character falls in love with the young girl is questionable, especially considering he has a beautiful, funny and intelligent wife played by Helen Vinson. Perhaps it's the Polish girl's youth and innocence he's attracted to, but I think he's not as heroic as the movie-makers intend him to be. The wife does leave him alone in snowy New England to work on his novel, but he needn't stab her in the back by falling in love with another. Cooper's character comes off somewhat of a cad, and I never was able to sympathize with him enough to make me really care about his final happiness.<br /><br />The movie paints the wife as a shallow but glamorous socialite, caring only for the next party of get-away weekend at his expense. But at about two-thirds into the movie and after she has read his manuscript, she has a strong and wonderful scene with Sten where she discusses the hypothetical endings for the novel. Vinson really shines in this scene, which includes one incredibly long take with at least three pages of dialog. I thought both Vinson and the often-maligned Sten made it all work very nicely. This was the moment when you can see the strength under the airy facade, of Vinson's character.<br /><br />The movie takes a very dark turn partway through, and some of the scenes really rise to the level of verbal and physical abuse, something I hadn't expected to see. But the production values are great, Greg Toland's camera work shines, and the locations and sets are really convincing.<br /><br />But what somewhat bothered me in its intensity were these two scenes with Sten and her family. How brutal is the scene where her father and Ralph Bellamy want her to watch Bellamy slaughter pigs? I mean she said about 5 times that it makes her sick, and they kept insisting. And then finally after she runs off -- she and the audience get to hear the sound effect of pigs squealing as they're being butchered. Didn't expect this movie to go there...<br /><br />And then when her father, who was introduced as an amiable figure, gets so angry at Sten that he slaps her face with such intensity. Seemed pretty violent by today's standards...<br /><br />Finally, I admire and still wonder about the ambiguous ending. Obviously, the Polish girl has died. Vinson is standing next to Cooper as he gazes out the window. She speaks to him and then he remembers aloud how Sten would look coming up to the house. He sees her in his imagination. The camera pulls back, and now Vinson is no longer in the room or the scene. Did she leave him after all? Did she decide she didn't want to stay with a man who had such a love for another woman?\",\n",
              "  b\"I just watched Brooklyn Bound for the first time about half-hour ago and this film doesn't waste a minute of the film as every scene of this film are shot very well. The cinematography was great, it's meant for a film like this. the guy doing it clearly had the right idea and it works very well for low-budget. All of the acting was good - Jamie Hector(Paid In Full, HBO's The Wire) is VERY effective in his role as is the scarce Dean Winters(HBO's Oz) w/ some strong acting. After watching the Brooklynite Jamie Hector play out his part as the strong and silent Marlo opposite Wood Harris in The Wire, It was the straw that broke the camel's back in making me consider this movie even though I was pretty sold on the title itself. The film itself shows the hard times in Brooklyn and it shows the cultural diversity which makes the film so meticulous and the scenes in the projects can be compared to the likes of New Jersey Drive and Clockers only they used actual Brooklyn n!&&@s for the film. What I really loved about the movie was the fact that REAL NEW YORK STREET SLANG IS USED CORRECTLY!!! The film itself doesn't pull any punches and keeps it very real and for that I recommend this film to anyone who likes urban film - Brooklyn Bound is a gem under the radar....\",\n",

I loved every episode of those. <br /><br />But last season I stopped watching after the 4th or 5th episode. I don't remember seeing a show in which I didn't like a single contestant. They either had no personality or were too bitchy. TAR's aim for diversity produced some of the most ridiculous array of contestants that I've seen. We had an equal helping of Muslims, handicapped, Indians, homos, and ho's. I hope they have better characters next season.\",\n",
              "  b\"To say that this movie is a let down would be a tremendous understatement. Sitting on the shelves of various high street DVD outlets, resplendent in its Two Disc Special Edition packaging and with a back cover blurb that brings up director Yuen Woo Ping's work as fight choreographer on The Matrix Trilogy and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you have to give credit for the packaging department for luring you into a false sense of belief that this movie is a hitherto overlooked milestone in HK action. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />I've heard it compared to the similarly disastrous Speed 2. In truth, the only link between the two is the setting on a luxury liner. Unlike Speed 2, where the task of slowing the out of control vessel was central to the plot, here, the ship is little more than something big, large and isolated for Kenny Ho to run around in. And speaking of Ho, his role as lead action hero leaves a lot to be desired. While he can handle the gun play and martial arts with as much flair as his contemporaries, his facial expressions remain largely unchanged throughout. There is a back story involving his dead wife which could have granted him more sympathy, but it is so woefully mishandled it feels like something that was tacked on for no particular reason. Twenty minutes after the credits roll, it's unlikely you'll remember anything about him. Besides, how can you feel any backing for a man who is supposed to be a security chief, yet fails to stop the villains from massacring nearly every passenger on the boat?<br /><br />However, his co-star Elaine Lui really stands out. Not because she's a good actress you understand, but because her role as the comic relief slapstick foil backfires spectacularly as she becomes one of the most irritating screen heroines to appear in the Hong Kong Legends catalogue. A little bit of comedy in action films is okay now and again, but considering the ridiculously high bodycount and number of innocent people murdered in this movie, she seems very out of place. Her fight with Christy Chung for example is extremely tasteless, as Lui imitates martial arts stances and goes through a bumbling slapstick routine, mere minutes after a young girl watched her mother machine gunned before her eyes.<br /><br />All in all then, not worth the effort. The action sequences are decent enough, but a bland leading man, immensely irritating heroine and a complete absence of emotion result in a film that Yuen Woo Ping would most probably want to forget.\",\n",
              "  b'Beauty and the Beast tells the story of Belle, an unusual but beautiful girl, who goes in search of her inventor father and comes across a mysterious castle. She enters the castle in search of her father, to discover it is occupied by a beast. She becomes his prisoner. The beast is loveless and thankless, but she soon begins to fall in love with him, and he with her. The film\\'s end is happy, satisfying, and inspiring, showing what the power of love can do.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is a charming story of love and magic. It features lovely music. Songs like \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Be Our Guest\", and \"Belle\" are catchy and fun to listen to. It features first-class characters: the quirky Belle; Gaston, the hateful attractive villain; the Beast, a character one can\\'t help but feels sorry for; the enchanted objects - Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, and Lumiere, characters that bring a lighthearted quality to the movie. Beauty and the Beast also features excellent executed animation. It isn\\'t hard to tell all the talent, the sweat, and the heart that was put in this film. The ballroom sequence, and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is great in another aspect: it\\'s ageless. Although it appears to be a children-oriented film, it doesn\\'t take much for an adult to find it extraordinarily appealing. It\\'s a fabulous film for the whole family to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />When I first saw Beauty and the Beast, I fell in love with it. It\\'s a beautiful tale, an engaging musical, and wonderful fable of romance. One of the greatest examples of traditional animation in recent years, it will go down in history with other beautiful Disney masterpieces, like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, and Cinderella.',\n",
              "  b\"After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good. But when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss. Patiently i waited for it's DVD release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing. The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. For a start the direction is appalling. There's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. I wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future. Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe normally the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends, but he just doesn't look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along. The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story.\",\n",
              "  b'Indeed, not a bad documentary (barely a real film, the plot is just an excuse to the connection of the different flamenco scenes). Antonio Canales is surprisingly good as Caco, and the other characters are of no relevance to the story whatsoever. Orestes, Caco\\'s nephew with cerebral palsy, is actually Antonio Canales\\' nephew. Undoubtable epic flavor in this escape/flamenco journey. Good details, as the nice landscapes in Cadiz and the references to Caco\\'s relative \"exiled\" in the Spanish cities of North Africa. Great and not so commercial flamenco singers, such as La Paquera(R.I.P) and La Caita. Special attention to the closing song, \"Naci en Alamo\".',\n",
              "  b'The screen icon is a police detective with a difference in this very moody and formidable thriller from writer / director Richard Tuggle. He portrays Wes Block, a loving and responsible father on one hand, and on the other a sex addict with a yen for prostitutes. He\\'s on the trail of a sex murderer, and realizes that he\\'s really not too different from this deviant.<br /><br />Tuggle illustrates the darkness inside many of us quite literally in this movie, to which anyone who\\'s seen this can agree. There\\'s even a line to that effect spoken by a minor character. It\\'s definitely a daring project for the actor, who\\'s solid and believable as always; he has an especially potent scene where he trashes a room in rage and frustration as he realizes the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />The movie doesn\\'t play out as one might expect. There\\'s not much of a sense of urgency, even as the bodies pile up. It takes a real psychological approach as we witness the deterioration of our central character, who at least gets a strong female character to relate to as Genevieve Bujolds\\' role is introduced into the plot. She does a creditable job as well, creating a kind of moral center and giving the movie a solid anchor.<br /><br />Eastwoods\\' own daughter Alison plays one of his two daughters in the movie, and she\\'s very good, foregoing any sort of \"cutesy\" routines that child performers can fall into. Also appearing in a supporting role is Dan Hedaya as a fellow detective, although he\\'s a little under-utilized.<br /><br />The killer himself is barely established as a character in the film, seen almost exclusively in the act of stalking and murdering his victims. We learn almost nothing about him, he has barely any dialog, and the end reveal is very fleeting, making him quite a mysterious entity indeed.<br /><br />The jazz score and the location shooting in New Orleans add a highly appropriate and engaging amount of flavor, and there\\'s a great climactic chase lit by a helicopter.<br /><br />It wasn\\'t altogether satisfying for me, but it\\'s an intriguing and steamy thriller and is certainly worth a watch.<br /><br />7/10',\n",
              "  b'I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, yet keeping an attentive eye. I waited for the next awful special effect, or the next ridiculously clich\\xc3\\xa9d plot item to show up full force, so I could learn how not to make a movie.<br /><br />It seems when they set out to make this movie, the crew watched every single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good vs. evil movie ever made, and saw cool things and said: \"Hey, we can do that.\" For example, the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking, is the one car the protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown on to. The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it. The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways, happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP. Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. Then the guy protecting the VIP says \"Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?\" He gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies, he gets whacked in an almost comically clich\\xc3\\xa9 fashion. Then for no apparent reason, defying logic, convention, and common sense, the dumb ass VIP GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK!!! A lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn\\'t make sense. Transparent acting distanced me from the movie, as well as bad camera-work, and things that just make you go: \"Wow, that\\'s incredibly cheesy.\" Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1, because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.',\n",

If you're bored, it might be worth watching but try and find something else first.<br /><br />The characters are annoying, it's hard to care about any of them as they're all so over the top and shouting all the time. Claude is too nice in an annoying way and why do the people with better jobs have to be the ones who are full of themselves? I actually prefer the horrible ones because occasionally they do actually make you laugh unlike Claude and her pals, complete misfits who's characters have been done before (the white geeky guy and the black strong mama type) it's all very safe, unoriginal and boring.<br /><br />Most of the episodes are about the same thing, the bitchy ones are horrible to the nice ones, the nice ones retaliate and they all learn a lesson..all without getting any work done. There are a few OK episodes and i tried to give this show a chance but there's so many other better things to watch out there, this is just an average sitcom with no x factor.\",\n",

The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless.<br /><br />I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me, as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. Lots of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either.<br /><br />Possibly there is something there that I totally missed.

              "  b'I truly consider Tightrope to be by far one of Eastwood\\'s best acting performances. He definitely DID deserve, that year, at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. And don\\'t be mistaken, Wes Block has nothing to do with Dirty Harry ... true, these two cops both have their \"dark side\" -an aspect that Eastwood has learned to exploit in a number of his pictures, BUT Wes Block appears to be much more \"human\" than Harry. This single father is struggling with his own demons, persuaded that until now he has screwed up about everything in his life, beginning with his marriage ... he\\'s trying real hard to be a good father, as well as a good cop, that is until this killer comes along and threatens all he\\'s been fighting for to preserve.<br /><br />Here we get to know a guy who\\'s extremely vulnerable, hurt, un-self confident, haunted and whose relationship with women remains ambiguous, based on control, kind of as if he was afraid of them, of what they could do to him, seeing them as a threat ... hence his resort to the services of prostitutes and his use of handcuffs on them.<br /><br />As usual in Eastwood\\'s movies, we wanna know what\\'s underneath this front his characters put on ... -like in Pale Rider, Josey Wales, The Bridges of Madison County ... the silences, the puzzling, haunting, deep looks, that tell us far more about a character than any word would. \"Less is more\" is definitely a guideline of this movie. Most of the time, Eastwood\\'s characters reveal themselves through their silences, and it\\'s particularly true here.<br /><br />I believe there\\'s a line in Tightrope that sums up pretty accurately what Eastwood\\'s movies are really about: \"I\\'m not sure how close I wanna get ...\" They\\'re about very private men struggling with life.<br /><br />This movie is simply one of his best.',\n",

He presses charges, which arouses the kids\\' ire, and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign.<br /><br />Marilyn Manson, er, Marlyn Mason rather, plays his fretful, boiled-celery wife, who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses, and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But The System is getting Culp nowhere, and he\\'s not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what movie people do when The System fails...(but this is based on a true story, which makes it even better).<br /><br />It should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient \\'70s funk-o-matic \"teenage\" theme music that warns us when they\\'re up to no good, this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even-handedly (really!). It doesn\\'t make a big generational thing out of it. Kudos for that.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice, and you like fire, and you like justice for dogs by way of fire, and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are \"too damn soft,\" then this flick\\'s ethos is up your alley. No, it\\'s not really \"good,\" at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word. There\\'s nothing subtle or understated or clever about it, it\\'s just sort of a feature-length PSA for vigilantism. It does, however, capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other, beloved works. Remember in Frank Miller\\'s The Dark Knight Returns when Batman leads the Mutants on horseback to reclaim Gotham City? Remember that scene in A Christmas Story where the kid pounds the bully\\'s face in? Remember how cool that was? Or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors? Yeah, mon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was a 1973 made-for-TV movie that I just happened to catch at 4am on my local WB affiliate, and it\\'s probably not destined for DVD release.

              "  b'The very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist, and my thought was: \"This is almost too beautiful.\" And it goes on like this: Images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each of them perfect in every detail. Even the girl\\'s room, her father\\'s car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This could seem outdated and escapistic, but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty, happening on the border between life and fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of it. The extreme parsimony of the movie, having a simple, slow story, just one actor and hardly any special effects, exerted a strong magic. I therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as a grown-up woman, and her son) are introduced. Another shortcoming is the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I couldn\\'t bring an English pop-song together with French mountain glory. I went to the movie together with my two small daughters, but I recommend it to adults as well, given that they appreciate this kind of movie. Obviously, not everybody does.',\n",

              "  b'****MINOR SPOILERS*** As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet \"Hobgoblins\" stands apart from all others in it\\'s own unique way. Classic baddies such as \"The Creeping Terror,\" \"The Mighty Gorga\" and \"Manos\" are uniformly bad from start to finish. \"Hobgoblins\" on the other hand, starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept \"Club Scum\" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. With just this one film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Watch \"Hobgoblins\" and wonder no longer.',\n",

Awful production values. Awful acting. Awful script. I would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances Asian American awareness in Hollywood (This film does neither.).<br /><br />I would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing. If you are curious, perhaps a rental from Netflix, but this film is definitely not for keeps.<br /><br />If you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your Asian American film awareness, and came away disappointed, then I recommend the following films for your personal viewing. These are well-written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of Asian American actors:<br /><br />Better Luck Tomorrow <br /><br />Mulan',\n",

I think that if you have the extra time, and see it playing, give it a look. You might enjoy it. Personally, the wizard was the best part of the movie for me, and he kept me laughing. The names of the people were a great rip on the movie \"The Lord of the Rings\", which made it so much more funny for me.<br /><br />The movie holds a lot of fun if you give it a chance.

But hey, it was set in Scotland and we don\\'t see too many films like that so I sat down to watch... So what a treat I got!! This film is well-acted (especially by the two leads) and utterly engaging. I agree parts of the plot were wafer thin but it presented as a fairytale and a cracking good one at that. It was just joyful and poignant and above all uplifting. I am Scottish but neither Asian or gay so others can discuss any significance about such matters, for me it was just a great watch and that is all I care about.',\n",
              "  b\"What a disappointment! Forsyth's book is one of his more varied, in terms of characters as well as in visual terms. Unhappily, the scriptwriters pretended that they knew better than Forsyth how to tell a story, and they got rid of the mining guy's story, of old Manson's greed and of young Manson's lust, and of the tribal question story, in exchange for a meaningless story about Shannon's wife, and the one of the pain-in-the-ass journalist who gets killed, which distracts the spectator's attention. As a result, the special effects/explosion specialist is given a free hand in a pitiful attempt to fill the holes in the story with smoke and fire... Walken is great, as always,locations are good, but they are no reason to avoid films scripted by Gary DeVore and/or George Malko in the future.Yiiiik! Don't see the film, read the book.\",\n",

When her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a `Murder Club,' Maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to `Level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage (for denting her car!). But is Maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it?<br /><br />The plot of this film (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly conceived, full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous, out-of-left-field twist ending. Some of the dialogue is downright laughable. I didn't have a problem with Rochon's performance, but the supporting cast was atrocious. However, I managed to sit through this Full Moon release thoroughly entertained. There's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart.

Cast and the core of the story were really not bad....not bad..actually that's, what this movie was. But it could have been really great. It was not because the actors sometimes could not be convincing enough. Actually it was not an actor-problem, but more a screenplay- or director-problem. The adjustment of the original story with a standard hollywood-template simply was too obvious. The atmosphere was not bad, but it was not really continuous. The cuban flair and atmosphere of the setting also could have been brought to the screen in a more intense way. So it lacked the great excitement. But you always can do it better. In fact it was a really romantic, erotic, entertaining and thrilling lovestory (sorry...a story about love ;-)). Compared to the horrible standard crap-romances you could see at the cinemas the last years it was very refreshing. Watch it without great expectations and you will be surprised. 7 Stars!!\",\n",

              "  b'I had the pleasure of seeing this movie twice. Once while attending the Garden State Film Festival and a second time in my home town in the Connecticut Film Festival. Normally I would never Pay to see a movie twice.<br /><br />This action adventure thrill ride is near and dear to any guy/girl who is young at heart. The story combined with thrills made the movie easy to relate to. The Flyboys is definitely the best adventure movie I have scene ever, and that is coming from a film major who sees movies all the time. The story had the viewers demanding for what came next and on the edge through out the entire movie.<br /><br />The way that this movie connects to you, is how you can relate to it. The characters and choice of the characters was great and they worked together amazingly well as if they knew each other their entire life. Most times after you see a independent film there is always one character that stands out due to bad acting. This did not exist, and let the viewer instantly connect with the characters as if they were sitting next to them. <br /><br />With out spoiling the movie I need to Jump to the Creator Rocco DeVilliers. Rocco has created a movie that looks like it required 100 million but only done with two million. He has made a film that was made over the course of 7 years. His movie has beaten all the other independent films at the festivals I have been to. I walked out of all the other movies saying that was good but not as good as \"The Flyboys\". <br /><br />The question remains why hasn\\'t the movie been released in theaters every where? The answer is \"LA won\\'t take it\" . After hearing Rocco say this at both film festivals the audience was instantly appalled and began to boo.<br /><br />The best thing that you can do after reading this review is to watch \"The Flyboys\". With out spoiling the movie I could not give a in depth review to prove to you how well this film was made, but at least now you know what you can do to help the progress of this wonderful film.<br /><br />PS. the guy who said this would be better than the new Indiana Jones, he was absolutely right.',\n",
              "  b'oh my god, i give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons. the final sequence is once again quite effectively handled and it was absolutely hilarious. that is what it gets those three points for. other than that, it was atrocious. it wasnt meant to be this funny, that much is obvious, but the dubbing, the acting of the dubbed voices, the dialogue they said, where often hilarious. the actions performed, and/or not performed also lead to much hilarity and/or throwing things at the screen. such as when the whole town is being slaughtered and one small group of people stand on a balcony looking on as if they were watching a cooking glass, or the \"attempted\" escapes from the church in which they hole up.<br /><br />evil mayor: i think something is going on outside so you should go upstairs and look out the window.<br /><br />hero: ok.<br /><br />evil mayor: now is my chance to make some idiot go outside and flail around with fire being totally ineffective and getting hacked up.<br /><br />insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />evil mayor: damn, wait, i will get this small child and she will walk outside and cry pappa seemingly obvlious to the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers but are actually zombies with no flesh or skin or anything and she will lead them away and i will flee! insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />hero (upstairs): he is trying to escape again, fool, and he has left the door open, he is silly, this is a nice view.<br /><br />woman: where is my daughter?<br /><br />hero (downstairs now): i dont know, i cannot see her anyway and she was not outside because i could not see her despite her being out there and me having a view of the entire neighbourhood and she is standing right outside, where on earth could she be?<br /><br />needless to say, anybody would be throwing things at the screen after 10 minutes of this. so, watch the first film with a couple of friends, having a few drinks, and make sure by the time you get to watching this one, you are absolutely blindly drunk and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all. and there wasnt even any decent gore, such a shame.',\n",
              "  b'John Mudoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a bathtub completely naked, with blood dripping down his forehead, unaware of what is happening, he remembers nothing. In the next room he finds a dead body and a blood stained knife. What follows is john trying to piece together what is happening to him and what he unravels is one of the greatest science fiction stories ever put to film. There is a group called the strangers who have an ability to physically change surroundings of them and the people living in the city, they call this ability \"tuning\". They soon discover that john also has this ability, which is impossible as it would take a normal human a few lifetimes to gain the ability to \"tune\". Thats the most i can tell without giving away major plot points.<br /><br />The movie is set in a 1940ish looking city where detectives are hunting John, along with the mysterious strangers. The tall buildings and the knowledge that the strangers could be anywhere in the city gives a menacing ambiance, heightening the tension in the movie and giving off a great effect on the viewer. The special effects in Dark City are stunning and realistic, especially when certain characters use \"tuning\".<br /><br />Rufus Sewell gives a good performance as John Murdoch, though i could\\'nt help feeling he was holding back somewhat. I could think of a few other actors who could have gave a much better performance but he was generally good.<br /><br />Kiefer Sunderland as Dr. Daniel Schreber was very good and seemed to have put all of his effort into his character, its quite an unusual role for Sunderland but he pulls it off pretty well.<br /><br />Another performance worth mentioning is Richard O\\'Brien as Mr Hand, he gives a genuinely creepy performance as one of the main strangers, i thought i would see him and think crystal maze through all of his scenes but he does a pretty good job of playing a convincing character.<br /><br />Overall the movie leaves a few unanswered questions, leaving the viewer to conduct their own theories about the outcome of events. I have a good grasp of the story as a whole but some people will find bits and pieces confusing. A great film anyways, i gave it an 8 because it tends to drag in some spots, but the end makes up for all doubts.',\n",
              "  b'Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great), the personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture through time). What is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance: chucking mainstream American culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.<br /><br />I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, putting on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night. Often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script off sheets of paper. Sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. I was never happier. Except for the hooting and hollering, seeing \\'Riding Giants\\' took me back in time.<br /><br />IT also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge, not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder, not keeping up with the Joneses, pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question, \"what is the purpose of life?\" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: to live life solely on our own terms. Maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.<br /><br />It was this message that really impressed me.',\n",

              "  b'A taut and topical political thriller that, unfortunately, goes off the rails.<br /><br />In its defense, the basic premise is plausible, the writing is tense and dramatic, and the acting and direction are professional. Other posters have complained about implausibilities in the plot, and the wrong names used for things. A political thriller must have some unexpected twists or there would be no story, and we can assume that the \"H2O\" world has different names for things like the RCMP and War Measures Act.<br /><br />The series, however, goes off the rails in the third hour. We can accept one or two extremely implausible events if the story requires it, but when near-impossible events happen again and again, with a new one each few minutes, credibility crumbles. Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.<br /><br />I\\'ll give an example. An assassin is killing anyone, no matter how powerful or insignificant, who threatens the conspiracy. One of the major characters is a police detective who is about to unravel the plot. The assassin traps her, spills clues about the conspiracy, and then lets her go. This is an absurd Hollywoodism, like something from an old Flash Gordon serial. There are even bigger howlers in the series, and I know what happens later, but this is the one that made me want to throw something at the TV.<br /><br />The series plays like it was written by a committee, and each member wanted to get their plot twist in whether it made sense or not. The ending is a disappointment too; there is yet another plot twist in the last few minutes and the story just stops. All the viewer is left with is a huge number of unresolved plot twists.',\n",

I recorded it because it was rated highly in the TV listings and starred Matthau, who I always like, but during the opening credits' bucolic scenes of Matthau playing with a little boy to the movie's unutterably treacly score (the sort of thing you heard in TV movies of the 70s) I thought, oh god, what am I in for? Matthau's windbag character also instantly turned me off. So I came here to see what people thought, and saw one glowing review after another. And that inspired me to watch another hour before giving up.<br /><br />Besides the truly abysmal score, Kotch suffers from a surfeit of annoying characters. Kotch himself is genial but tedious, his son is bland and his daughter-in-law plays the requisite bitch. The girl he eventually helps is about as annoying as the title character.<br /><br />I can't figure out why people like this movie so much.

I love this movie as much today as I did at 14, which at that time I did not know that he had just died.

              "  b'My third viewing of this masterpiece some time ago revealed to me just how brilliant it really is. Expertly directed, well-crafted, and featuring an intriguing story, State of Grace was unfortunately overlooked upon it\\'s debut in 1990 in favor of more well-known gangster films, such as Goodfellas and the bookend to Coppola\\'s epic Godfather trilogy.<br /><br />I\\'m not sure how a film of this caliber can go so grossly overlooked, even nowadays (though, as is the case with many films, it\\'s appreciation has been snowballing the last few years.) All I can say is that it has quickly propelled itself to the elite of my favorite films, and I consider myself lucky to have it sitting in my DVD shelf. <br /><br />State of Grace was one of the earliest films that depicted the Irish mob, a topic that, so far, has an impeccable track record at being transitioned to the screen: Miller\\'s Crossing, a masterpiece by the Coen Brothers that arrived the same year as this film and was also criminally overlooked, 2003\\'s Road to Perdition, Sam Mendes\\' beautiful father/son epic, and, most recently, Martin Scorsese\\'s triumphant return to the genre with his slick adaptation of Hong Kong blockbuster, The Departed. <br /><br />State of Grace takes place in the gritty environment of Hells Kitchen, New York City. Terry Noonan (Sean Penn) is an undercover cop from Boston, on a mission to infiltrate one of the top crime organizations headed by Frankie Flannery (Ed Harris) and his brother, Jackie (Gary Oldman), Noonan\\'s boyhood pals. While in town, Terry falls into his old ways with Jackie, and requests that Frankie put him on the payroll as a worker. He also rekindles his relationship with the brothers\\' sister, Kate (Robin Wright.) <br /><br />As Terry becomes more and more entrenched in the underground affairs of Frankie and Jackie, his morals become devastatingly conflicted. He finds that his allegiance to his pals is at ends with his job assignment. His devotion to either is constantly tested. Things take a turn, however, when Frankie\\'s psychotic methods and attempts to align with a powerful Italian syndicate reveal him to be worse than Terry imagined, and he takes matters into his own hands. <br /><br />Specific mention of the top three actors deserves marquee attention. It is rare that you\\'ll find a cast headlined by as talented a trio as that of State of Grace. Sean Penn, Ed Harris, and Gary Oldman are all their most fierce, and rarely have either of them been better. Each brings something different that is crucial to the movie\\'s success, and the entire package would have been brought down severely without either of them. Penn\\'s tortured cop, who finds himself reverting more and more to the old lifestyle that he tried to get away from, is the crux of the movie. The anguish and guilt that he keeps bottled up inside him really conveys how difficult a situation he is in. Harris adds another level to the cold, calculating mob boss. His sadistic nature is matched beautifully with a fear he protrudes subtly. And Gary Oldman, who never requires any commendation, is, as always, spectacular. He steals every frame of the movie he\\'s in as the impulsive, hot-headed brother/best friend who values little in life, except family and the task at hand. As Harris brings \"cold\" to another level, Oldman supplies an entirely new definition of \"crazy\". All of the work done by each of these talents shows why they are considered some of the best in the business. <br /><br />The supporting cast deserves recognition. The three leads are backed by an impressive cast of character actors, who lend fervently to the style and attitude of the film. Superb character actors John Turturro and John C. Reilly make whatever impressions the lead three allow them, and Robin Wright is a smoldering pillar of sensuality as Penn\\'s love interest (soon to be his wife in real life), and she fleshes out a bit of back story. Burgess Meredith and R.D. Call are also superb. <br /><br />Ennio Morricone is at hand, and while his score here is not his best (certainly not a bad thing), it really adds to the feel of the movie; first played over the opening credits over a St. Patrick\\'s Day parade in slow motion, and reoccurring throughout the film, it is a nostalgic, haunting theme that takes us to times past and reminds us of the contexts of the scenario. <br /><br />The cinematography done by Jordan Cronenworth is strangely beautiful, making the well-played grit of the urban area look appealing. A shade of blues dominates the look of the film and gives it a glossy luster. <br /><br />The finale finds Penn marching to a bar in slow motion to the beat of and through a St. Patrick\\'s Day parade, followed by a shootout inter-spliced with footage of the parade, and it is one the coolest, most adrenaline-pumping scenes ever put to celluloid. <br /><br />It\\'s too bad this gem isn\\'t recognized more, because it\\'s a real treat. I\\'ve found a new perennial favorite, one that is perfect for every third Thursday in March. <br /><br />The Italian mafia films are great, but it\\'s great to have a few standing points on the board for us Irish.<br /><br />Erin Go Bragh!',\n",

For a change, Paulette Goddard plays the nurse with most of the male admirers (Sonny Tufts in particular), with Veronica Lake showing up late in a decidedly unsexy role (about which I can\\'t say much more than that, lest I ruin it for you). Both offer up career performances, if that\\'s saying much. Their leader, durable talent Claudette Colbert, holds the troop together throughout, despite numerous tragedies. Helping to prop *her* up is her persistent suitor George Reeves (later of the TV series, \"Superman\"). Interesting for the fact that it was shot while the war was still raging ~ so there are a lot of decidedly non-PC references to \"Japs\" ~ but this is a real salute to the unsung women who served in \"the big one.\" A must-rent.<br /><br />4 Stars.',\n",
              "  b'First off, Robot Chicken is the ultimate parody show. There are no real story lines. The episodes consist completely of various parody skits and sketches. The sketches last 6-7 minutes tops. Most of them only last a few seconds to a minute! They animators use only toys and clay figures which, in my opinion, adds to the hilarity. And it\\'s packed with senseless violence that shames even Mortal Kombat. Batman, Robin, the Mario Brothers, Brittany Spears, N\\'Sync, Hillary Duff, Fred Flintsone, the Little Drummer Boy, The Nutcracker and even Cap\\'n Crunch and Tony the Tiger have all been brutally killed by the twisted creators of the show. So often the violence is completely pointless. For example, in one skit we see a trio of kids enjoying their \"Phillis Diller Spray n Play\" sprinkler. Suddenly, the sprinkler goes haywire and kills all three of the kids in completely disgusting manners that left me breathless from laughing so hard. The tentacles on the sprinkler impale one kid\\'s chest, rip the shin off the second kid and tear open the head of the third kid. In another skit, a granny fights her fellow senior citizens in a massive nursing home for absolutely no reason. Nothing is safe from the geniuses behind the show. They even find ways to make children\\'s franchises such as the Carebears and Clifford the Big Red Dog excessively violent. There\\'s way too much to even go to detail on but if you like senseless violence and carnage, this show is for you!',\n",

              "  b'\"Der Clown\" is the movie version of the German TV \\xc2\\x96 series by the same name, running quite successful from 1996 to 2001. The series was about some guy who is officially dead but in truth is sitting in his hideout, waiting for the bad guys to move. Whenever something is seriously wrong, he\\'ll put on a clown mask and go rampage, vigilante \\xc2\\x96 style. So far, so good, on to the Big Screen...<br /><br />A merry bunch of bad guys with hockey masks wants to steal the German gold reserves. The guy who once was the Clown has retired after his girlfriend was killed in action, but now it\\'s time for him to take his costume out of the vault, put on the smelly rubber mask again and kick some bad butt.<br /><br />Boy, this has gone wrong. Big time trash bonanza! First of all, it was not shot on 35 mm, it does not even look like 16 mm, I have a certain feeling that they did it on video. Bad video, that is, with the predominant colours being red (explosions, the actors\\' faces) and grey (everything else). It looks terrible, but on the other hand, that fits quite well with about all other aspects of this production. The movie desperately tries in every scene to imitate big loud Hollywood action flicks (which is absolutely okay), but obviously the makers neither have the talent nor have they understood anything (not okay). Every five minutes there is a big, red (you know, video) explosion or something, our heroes escape one way or the other, with always the same pathetic piece of score. I would accept that those scenes do not have any kind of emotional impact, but the movie does not even work as an entertaining no-brainer, never! And whose fault is this? Yes. Send in the director, writer, editor and all the other clowns responsible for this catastrophe! May they lower their red video faces in shame!<br /><br />The screenplay was obviously written by a chimp that was tied to a typewriter. It reveals a total lack of sense for pace, logic, characters, dialog, you name it. There is absolutely no storytelling. You could zap into this crap every time, stay with it for five minutes and change the channel again, without the feeling that you\\'re missing something before or after what you just watched, it has made-for-TV written all over (Afterwards I even had problems to summarize the story at all...). This terrible excuse for a script is turned into an uninspired, uninterrupted inferno of hectic, shaky shots. Honestly, I saw home movies that had more virtuosity than this. Heck, not even the action sequences look good! The most annoying thing however is the extensive, completely unmotivated use of time warps and split screen effects throughout the whole movie (I don\\'t mean two or three times, it is in almost EVERY scene). And for those who are still with us: The sound mixing is the worst I was forced to listen to in years. Bad, bad, bad!<br /><br />But I wouldn\\'t say that it is not entertaining. \"Der Clown\" features tons of incredible, unintentionally funny moments, e.g. a stunt, where at least a dozen burning police cars fly through the cloud of an explosion (red, of course) on a highway. Yes, this is a cool stunt. No, it is by no means a tragic, emotional scene which would maybe, and only maybe, justify the use of slow motion and pathetic syntheziser strings for two long minutes. It however gets really, really tasteless when the main character has a flashback of how his girlfriend died. This is edited like a music video, with the lethal bullet entering the girl\\'s body within the rhythm of the music. My god, what were they thinking??<br /><br />If you\\'re into trash and maybe even survived last year\\'s moron fiesta \"Daniel \\xc2\\x96 Der Zauberer\", this is definitely a must see. If not, be warned. You\\'ll probably feel the urge to go rampage afterwards, vigilante \\xc2\\x96 style.',\n",
              "  b'Every so often a film comes along that is misunderstood by critics and ignored by the public, but is subsequently rediscovered and reappraised. I sincerely hope that \"For the Boys\" will join those ranks. It is an uncommonly sincere, insightful and touching film, and the only things to be held against it amount to quibbles. True, the old age make up is dreadful, and the last five minutes seriously weaken the impact of the film, but the sum total is moving and perceptive.<br /><br />Bette Midler, giving the performance of her career to date, was robbed of the Oscar in my opinion. It is a brave and sincere effort on her part, and such a pity that it was not met with greater recognition. James Caan plays the shallow, slightly dim Eddie Sparks almost too well. There are times when he truly frightened me. The performances on the whole are restrained; when the occasion for histrionics comes, both stars rise to it.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended. I sincerely hope this film finds its audience one day.',\n",

There are numerous unneeded scenes of sex with A LOT of flesh (but no nudity -- go figure). The dialog was trite and not believable. There are characters that appear briefly to move the story along with no explanation of who they are.<br /><br />And the ending.

              "  b'I believe the title speaks for itself. Date Movie has indeed earned a well deserved place in IMDb\\'s bottom 100. The film is packed with disgusting images that would make any decent human being sick to his or her stomach. From the cat humping a nearly mummified corpse to Eddie Griffin spitting out a mammoth hairball in slow motion, the humor in this movie is downright distasteful. Sure, everyone needs a dumb comedy to laugh at once in a while, but there is nothing funny about the family cat raping Grandma\\'s freeze-dried remains.<br /><br />There are several moments in this movie that could be funny were they not dramatically overdone. For instance, when the cat is sitting on the toilet with diarrhea for two whole minutes. It was comical for the first thirty seconds, but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end. Even more so is the opening sequence when Alyson Hannigan is dancing through the street in a fat-suit. No offense\\xc2\\x97I\\'m a bit on the heavy side myself\\xc2\\x97but no one wants to see a soaking wet obese woman dancing on her hands and knees. In the dinner scene, Adam Campbell\\'s orgasmic and continuous shouts of \"YES!\" are awkward to watch. Judah Friedlander plays Nicky, a fat slob covered from head to toe in grease stains who states one of the most disgusting lines of the film, \"When I think about the honeymoon my sac gets all tingly and s--t.\" That\\'s just nasty. Carmen Electra\\'s parody of Paris Hilton\\'s car washing commercial for the Hardee\\'s thick burger is sickening and it is shown in at least four flashbacks throughout the film. It\\'s simply overkill.<br /><br />To its credit, this film does have some key elements that most audiences enjoy in a movie. Boy meets girl, boy thinks girl is beautiful, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl face obstacles in their relationship, boy and girl overcome said obstacles, and they all live happily ever after. Sadly, this film could have been something enjoyable, but it instead we are faced with this warped piece of trash that only the most sick and uncouth can laugh at. This is a movie that will mean absolutely nothing to future generations (if it even exists to them at all). Yes, it had potential, but it turned out to be something repulsive.<br /><br />Really, Date Movie doesn\\'t deserve the attention it\\'s getting from me writing this review. I\\'m trying to impress upon all movie-goers what a saddening waste of time this film is. I heard warnings from friends, critics, and fellow movie buffs, but like an idiot I watched it anyway. Don\\'t make the same mistake I did. And if you are so curious that you decide to watch it against your better judgment, don\\'t eat before doing so.',\n",
              "  b\"A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.\",\n",
              "  b\"What an unsuspecting surprise. It was a Friday evening and after a long working week, I threw myself on the lounge with my wife and switched on the television for some brain numbing trashy entertainment. After channel surfing for a while - and an elbow from the wife who took charge of the remote control - we settled on this film, DINNER WITH FRIENDS.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a horror film about friends and divorces. I cringed at certain parts that were related to our lives, and most of all, I understood the pain of it all. There were times when I just wanted to get up and lose myself in the WWW of my computer, but I had to see this movie out.<br /><br />Apart from the film trying hard not to be too stage orientated, it was thought provoking cinema. In my world the dialog was precise. The acting, classic new age Hollywood bravado mixed with the old school! And the direction, very unobtrusive and it just got on with the story.<br /><br />At the end of it all, you know the film succeeded when it creates discussions and heated debates with your partner.

              "  b\"The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts. It is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan (as played by Clint Eastwood) so popular. He carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, Harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing. But it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen. And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `Sudden Impact,' directed by and starring Eastwood, so successful. In this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception: Whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.<br /><br />In his own inimitable way, Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time. So he does; as only `Dirty Harry' can. In a small town north of San Francisco, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O. employed by the perpetrator. Unaccountably, Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief, Jannings (Pat Hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere. Not one to be deterred, however, Harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke). Gradually, Harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture?<br /><br />Eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `Dirty Harry.' It had been seven years since the last `Harry' offering (`The Enforcer,' 1976), but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor. And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4. As with all the films he directs, Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end. <br /><br />The screenplay, by Joseph Stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `Dirty Harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith) is the most engaging since the original `Dirty Harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action. The characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of Harry's best catch-phrases: `Go, ahead-- make my day...'<br /><br />As Harry, Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular: He lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today. Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before. No matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry, or at least have him around. `Dirty Harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, Eastwood `is' Dirty Harry, without question, just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone, Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.' She manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre. Even amid the violence, Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life. Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood's Harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.<br /><br />In supporting roles, two performances stand out: Paul Drake, as Mick, creates the best `psycho' since Andy Robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `Dirty Harry.' With actually very limited screen time, Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience. This is the guy you can't wait to see Harry take care of in the end. Also effective is Audrie J. Neenan, who makes her character, Ray Parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city. It's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell (Horace), Mark Kevloun (Bennett) and Nancy Parsons (Mrs. Kruger). With a perfect blend of drama and action, `Sudden Impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience. 9/10.\",\n",
              "  b'\"The Visitor\" holds a rare distinction: of the thousands of films I\\'ve seen as a paying moviegoer and paid critic, it is probably the one at the VERY bottom of the barrel. Compared to this, \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and other Ed Wood movies come across as masterpieces of celluloid art. A weird Italian-American ripoff of the horror/sci-fi cycle of the \\'70s (from \"Omen\" to \"Close Encounters\"), this movie looks as though it was made by a hallucinating crew that tossed the old script and started with a new one every day. There is virtually no continuity - and most of the big Hollywood names apparently working for scale and by the day (Shelley Winters, John Huston, Glenn Ford, Sam Peckingpah, etc.) stagger very briefly about looking hung over and very confused. For years, I thought my dim recollections of this movie were a bad dream; but IMDb proves I actually DID sit through this, ah, epic. The most vivid memory I have of it, for some reason, is Shelley Winters doing a perky rendition of \"Shortn\\'ng Bread.\" Nelson Eddy must have spun in his grave - and if was dead yet, that probably killed him!',\n",

What it has is possibly the best combination of the above in any action movie every made. It takes the pieces that it has to work with and forms a better whole. The dialogue is good. The cast is good (Rickman is the best of the bunch). The plot is good. Together, they are great. This film is the benchmark by which all American action movies should be judged. If an action film is better than Die Hard, then it deserves to be praised for that achievement alone.<br /><br />I rate it a 8.5/10 in it's genre. I gave it a 9 here.\",\n",

              "  b'I waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /><br />I found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary. It did what it set out to do, show me something I had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored. I knew nothing of the Drag world and finding out about them and the \"Balls\" was just spectacular to me. These folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. The catty folks, the complainers (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the Drag Queen was wearing wasn\\'t a man\\'s coat!), the jealous, it\\'s all there like in every other competition. LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPETITION like it. Which I felt was a point.<br /><br />You had the older drag queen talking about how the Balls \"used\" to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the Balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was that important to them! Then there was sad stories, stories of who\\'s \"house\" and \"house mother\" brought out the best and the brightest in competition. It was interesting.<br /><br />Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, I lived through the so called \\'Madonna\\' craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her \"Vogue\" phase and rightfully so. If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldn\\'t have HAD a \"Vogue\" phase, I know that now. Credit should be given where credit is DUE. Makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary, they\\'ll learn they\\'re not as \"mainstream\" as they think.',\n",

Although he would go on to become one of the more delightful actors of the \\'30s and \\'40s, he shows little promise of that here, nor any sign of talent acquired during his previous 25 films.<br /><br />A prologue announces the virtuous intention of depicting a moral scourge so that an informed public can combat it--but this is clearly just a CYA that allows the intriguingly-named \"Personality Pictures\" company to run this cheesy exploitation flick past the already toothless production code office.<br /><br />Maude Lindsay (Almeda Fowler) runs a \"party girl\" service for business functions, and she tries to send her hootchiest coochies to the United Glass soiree. (The only real humor in the entire film comes from her secretary continually addressing her as \"Madame Lindsay,\" and Lindsay admonishing her, \"Don\\'t call me madam!\") John Rountree is an upright business man who wants to work with the district attorney to eliminate the party girl influence on doing business; his son Jay (Fairbanks) is a ne\\'er-do-wheel frat boy in love with dad\\'s secretary, Ellen (Jeanette Loff)--a girl with a secret.<br /><br />Jay and his frat brothers crash the United Glass party, and a drunken Jay is trapped by a party girl, herself in a delicate situation.<br /><br />The usual confusion ensues.<br /><br />As the previous commenter notes, the sound quality is abysmal, but it may be just as well--the dialogue is no great shakes. There are certain scenes painful in their laughableness, especially the death scene of a tender young thing who\\'s fallen 6 stories, and yet appears not to have a scratch on her.<br /><br />It\\'s a dreadful film, and not even dreadful in that delicious \"so bad it\\'s good\" sort of way.',\n",
              "  b'This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin\\' Gary is a small-town kid who is (assumed) well-liked for his many impersonations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for whom he is very passionate), Gary\\'s actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This results in him making various justifications for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast. In the second installment, Harris exploites the struggle between Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary. The third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for Harris\\' extreme sensitivity with the subject. Unlike the second installment, \"The Orkly Kid\" shows Gary as a truly troubled character. He struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast. The movie is depicted so realistically that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. Surely, one can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but may also identify with him as an outcast.',\n",

She has, unfortunately, been given no opportunities to show her considerable talent in film. While Cruel Intentions is a bad movie, Harvard Man is one of the worst - if not the worst - movie I have ever forced myself to sit through. The writing is practically non-existent. There are many scenes of back and forth dialogue with little purpose but to fill time. There are several simultaneous plots (gambling, drug addiction, sexual cheating, dealing with the mob), none of them interesting in their execution. There is no coherence - each plot thread seems forced in to fill time and is not interwoven with a big theme. One soon gets the feeling that the movie was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a hurry to meet a deadline. Harvard Man is transparently what it is: a quickly-made attempt to capitalize on Gellar's fame. To watch it is to wait for its end, amazed that such a thing actually made it as a major motion picture. I CAN'T believe the average rating here is close to 5. Anyone who says this movie is anything but awful is either mentally deficient or has an agenda. The only reason to watch this movie is to gawk at its atrociousness.\",\n",

Sadly, I hated reading about Jack Cassidy's tragic death. Wherever you are Jack, we miss you still after 30 years. Columbo always catches his man or woman even in this episode. As Columbo always says, there is no such thing as a perfect murder. Just when you think he's got away with his crimes, nothing could be further from the truth. If you love Columbo, you will love this episode and how he catches his man is just as much fun to watch and learn.\",\n",
              "  b\"This is another case of the sequel not being quite as good as the original. But don't take that as meaning that this film is bad because it was actually a pleasant surprise. For a sequel, from Disney, this actually hit the spot quite nicely.<br /><br />This sequel returns all the original characters from the first one and they all play off each other nicely. I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!). It has everything that successful Disney movies have with the smooth animation, decent storytelling and the occasional tug at your heart strings. I can think of many worse ways to spend 70 minutes of your time. I, as an adult, enjoyed this film but if you have kids this is a great one for them too. If animation doesn't bother you, give this one a shot!\",\n",
              "  b'I saw this advertised on Netflix in the \"Gay and Lesbian\" section and the synopsis sounded cute, so I thought to myself that it wouldn\\'t hurt to give this movie a shot.<br /><br />Wrong. From the beginning of the movie, we have one of the most unique plot lines ever to be featured in a gay movie... a hot sad gay guy has just been dumped by his boyfriend and looks for love in all the wrong places, starting with the escort section in the back of a gay rag! How unique! Not to mention the escort who shows up happens to be a good looking Australian guy stuck in a financial rut (who has the strangest bones and muscles ever seen in a torso). Needless to say, the escort is only interested in business, but the hot sad gay guy falls for him and helps him out by giving him a high-profile job at his business firm! Then it gets even more original from here. The escort falls in love with his business partner and here begins a complicated gay love triangle.<br /><br />What is with this rut lately of gay films that continually explore the sad and lonely single lives of very attractive gay men who are financially successful and situated that pairs them up with a very attractive \"come from the wrong side of the tracks\" guy in relationships that go awry? The only difference with this movie is that it was poorly acted and heavily laden with a continual line of gay clich\\xc3\\xa9s that as a gay viewer myself, I was embarrassed just watching it! This movie was so amateurish, it could only be adored by a pretentious small-town gay and lesbian film festival wedged between various film shorts and a documentary on gay life in Anytown, America. What a load of garbage and a waste of my time! I couldn\\'t identify with anything or anyone in this so-called \"movie\".<br /><br />It was neither charming nor witty. The plot was trite, the characters were shallow, the story writing was lazy and the whole idea was predictable from the start. If very attractive gay men can\\'t seem to get it together in the real world, then I guess the average Joe such as myself doesn\\'t have a snowball\\'s chance in Hell either! <br /><br />Gay or straight, this movie was trash. Watch \"Chuck and Buck\" instead.<br /><br />My Rating - 0 out of 10',\n",
              "  b\"I am dumber after having watched this movie. The plot, actors, story, and music all sucked. I know this is a low budget movie, but couldn't they go to some local college and get some people who can actually act. The plot was stupid,slow and really didn't make a lot of sense. The entire time I watched the movie, I made fun of the acting, and was never once scared. The thing that made the most mad was that the cover of the movie jacket had nothing at all to do with the movie. Totally fooled me into spending $4 on this film. The longer I watched, the more convinced I became that this was someone's final project for film making 101. And, I would give them an F!At one point, I thought someone was playing a joke on me, and put the wrong movie in the case. Don't waste your time on this, unless you are a masochist.\",\n",

Then you'll see what a good film this is.<br /><br />As the title foretells this is four short stories. They are a mix of horror and psychological thriller. Nicely sequenced and told. There are not special effects. The budget is low. The direction and acting could be better but is still not bad. But the end result is good. Personally I think most people don't get this movie (and hence rate it lower than they should) is because the endings are not pat like most Hollywood shows. They leave a lot to the imagination and things are not wrapped up with respect to where the characters involved stand.\",\n",

If you have read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no altering of scenes or characters. This is a film made by King fans for King fans.<br /><br />For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it is a 'gypsy curse' horror, with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for, to become thinner. The final third has some severe structural problems, and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little.<br /><br />There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you might as well read the book, because there is nothing new here...<br /><br />\",\n",
              "  b'In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Much to the dismay of Holly, a freak auto accident has recently killed his friend, according to those who knew Harry.<br /><br />But in searching for details of Lime\\'s death, Holly gets contradictory stories that don\\'t add up. One of the persons who knew Lime is an attractive woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) whose continued presence in the story invites suspicion. The film\\'s plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.<br /><br />The film\\'s story is okay. But what makes \"The Third Man\" really interesting is the B&W cinematography, by Robert Krasker. Unlike most films, camera movement here is restricted, so as to draw attention to each frame\\'s geometry. Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter. Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves. Further, very high-contrast lighting, especially in outdoor scenes at night, creates a bizarre, almost nightmarish look and feel, and are suggestive of German Expressionism.<br /><br />All of which results in a visual disorientation for viewers that parallels Holly\\'s disorientation both in the streets of Vienna and in his understanding of the circumstances surrounding Lime\\'s absence. In most outdoor scenes there\\'s a conspicuous lack of crowds, a lack of hubbub one would expect in a bustling city. Instead, only a few secondary characters appear in night scenes. This sparseness in characters on the streets conveys the impression that hidden eyes are watching Holly, ready to pounce at any moment from out of dark shadows.<br /><br />\"Everybody ought to (be) careful in a city like this\", says one character to Holly, as an implied threat. Soon, a man who wants to give Holly some valuable information is murdered.<br /><br />The script\\'s dialogue is quite impressive, with some interesting lines and points of view. Some of the dialogue is in German, which enhances authenticity.<br /><br />The film\\'s acting and editing are very, very good. Adding a slightly romantic, and at times melancholy, tone to this dark film is the music of the \"zither\", an instrument similar to a guitar, but sounding quite different.<br /><br />My one complaint about this film is that it\\'s hard to keep tabs on some of the background characters. Trying to connect names with faces can be difficult, resulting in some confusion.<br /><br />\"The Third Man\" tells an interestingly bleak story, set in a bleak, desolate urban environment, rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal B&W cinematography.',\n",
              "  b\"Many things could be said about this film - misleading, clich&#233;d, style over substance, but in the end the most important aspect plays the decisive role: this film is boring.<br /><br />The authors decided to present the film as a pseudo-documentary, but instead the viewer is subjected to seeing poorly acted commentary dialogue about prostitution over and over again. Maybe that would be interesting if the commentary itself had at least a spark of originality, alas... Person after person, every participant in this unwatchable boring mess says nothing but stereotypical b.s. It is almost as if the filmmakers made their product for someone from Mars - someone who has never seen or even heard of a prostitute in their entire life!<br /><br />Oh, there is also Denise Richards in this movie. Yes. We all know that Denise Richards adds credibility to any movie! Seriously though, Richards and Daryl Hannah are in this film, but why they are here is anyone's guess. Their scenes could be easily taken out - they are not important. Well, in fact, the whole film is not important - just skip it altogether and watch something else.\",\n",

The day when someone decided to make a documentary about the word fu*k was inevitable one day if you really think about it, and here it is. If only the main contributions weren't from dumb Americans who haven't a clue the word is Anglo Saxon in origin and not an abbreviation (Fornicate Under Command of the King?!?) Although some interesting points are put across, such as the release one feels from using the word and it's traditional use with negativity and sexual encounters. Although most of the talking heads are speaking in defence of the word, a few conservatives put their point across and speak of defence of a society with standards and decency. It's short and is more than satisfactory as a documentary, but as it is even pointed out, c*nt is the word really likely to send shudders down the spine. Why wasn't a documentary made of that? Probably not commercial enough. ***\",\n",

I left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role, even though I knew that was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with CP. By no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings. Most highly recommended.\",\n",

But on his way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. He doesn\\'t remember what happens and at the next ordinary day, his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings, are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character, is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out, how to become a normal human being again. By the way-his animal instincts, helps him in some situations. Schneider\\'s performance is a so-so. The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies, called mindless fun as I have written above. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in. He is a great comedian but this is not his best movie.',\n",

They are eloping and to steer clear of the \"authorities\", they take a back road that turns into an entrance to hell. Yeah, it\\'s corny but it\\'s very entertaining and very well done.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is very good and the production including scenery and music are top notch. I loved the fact that \"Hitler\" is played by Gilbert Gottfried! Anne Meara, Ben Stiller, and the lovable Richard Farnsworth are also in the film as well as the late Kevin Peter Hall. As always, Chad Lowe does an A+ performance as \"Charlie\". I loved \"Hell Cop\" too. This is a fun movie!

              "  b'Hurray for Hollywood. The same (or at least same type) anti-war, pseudo intellectual morons who attempted to BRAND Vietnam veterans with the Hollywood lies. The same smears, from those who have never served their country, in an attempt to discredit the only heroes we have left, the American Serviceman.<br /><br />Facts exist, studies have been made, papers have been written, and the facts are in re those who served in Vietnam compared to study groups comprised of those who served in the military, but not in Vietnam and groups of \"civilians\" that found ways to avoid military service. The Vietnam vet is better adjusted, less mental illness, healthier, wealthier, more productive, and less likely to act like a total butt wipe than the latter groups. The information is available to those that care to know the facts rather than to follow the California nutcases. When studies are made re the veterans of the Middle East and/or Afghanistan, the result will probably be the same.<br /><br />The American fighting men and women are not dopers, drunks, sadistic baby killing, dog drowning, prisoner torturing retards. No doubt some few go over the line. However if anyone has a question about that, who has never served anything but their own self-interest. they have not earned the right to either ask the question and do not deserve an answer.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones as the grieving father (not an retired officer by the way.. he played a retired sergeant)is as always EXCELLENT... Susan Sarandon as always is not believable... and Charlize Theron is Terrific, as always.. Those playing the friends of Jones\\'s deceased son are typical smarmy Hollywood types, trying to look like soldiers but would probably be better cast in movies like Broke Back Mountain..

              "  b'Movies are only effective if they involve the viewer; we can\\'t enjoy someone\\'s story if we don\\'t care about what happens to them. In general, the best way to do this (at least for a mainstream movie) is to present a strong story. Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, \"Minority Report\" is a tense thriller that poses a number of intriguing ethical questions.<br /><br />Welcome to the era of PreCrime: a world without murder. Three special people, known as the PreCogs, are about to predict murders before they happen. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) works for the PreCrime division, and is passionate that it works. But when the PreCogs predict that he is going to commit a murder, Anderton has to find out why before he is caught.<br /><br />If you could see into the future, does that mean that what you saw is really going to happen? Can someone change their mind at the last minute? Is it right to arrest someone for a crime that they were going to commit, but hadn\\'t done it yet? These questions lie at the heart of \"Minority Report,\" and fortunately they are not mentioned then disregarded; the whole storyline revolves around answering them.<br /><br />Despite his bizarre off-screen antics, Tom Cruise is a good actor. This is certainly one of his best performances. Anderton is a man who uses this opportunity to battle personal demons, although it only partly works. He is deeply troubled by his past, and that conflict makes Anderton an almost tragic figure. Cruise plays the part perfectly, and we never stop rooting for him. Colin Farrell is effective in his breakout role as Danny Witwer, the agent from the Judicial System who begins snooping around PreCrime, perhaps to take over John\\'s job. Max von Sydow brings a deep note of class to the film as PreCrime\\'s director, and John\\'s mentor, Lamar Burgess. It\\'s an effective performance, and for a man who could easily play an elderly man, von Sydow is certainly an arresting figure. Samantha Morton has the most difficult part as Agatha, one of the PreCogs. She\\'s bizarre, acting as if she\\'s on some sort of a drug. But Morton allows us to peek beneath to see her lucidity. Kathryn Morris, the always wonderful Lois Smith, and Mike Binder are good in bit parts, while Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare steal scenes in terrifically loopy performances.<br /><br />This is Steven Spielberg\\'s best film since \"Saving Private Ryan.\" He keeps the pace up, and shows us that he\\'s still a director, and not just a name on a marquee. Spielberg has a vivid imagination and brings everything to life. This is a science fiction film, but it is grounded in reality enough that it is plausible that everything that happens in this film could be real in the near future. The film is well-paced and put together; it\\'s a complex plot, and deals with some serious ethical questions, but it\\'s never confusing. Special note goes to his music selection. Spielberg mixes some classical music into the film very effectively, and the soundtrack by John Williams represents some of his best work.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the film is that in one scene, it breaks the rules the film functions by for its own convenience. That being said, most people won\\'t notice (or care).<br /><br />Note: while the action sequences are pretty standard stuff (albeit well-shot and choreographed), the flashbacks of murders are pretty graphic. This really pushes the boundaries of PG-13.',\n",

I don\\'t understand the pervading lack of \\'love\\' for its efforts, at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; it\\'s unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. There\\'s nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.<br /><br />Yes it\\'s silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that \\'ridiculous\\' is where Hollywood\\'s idea of mysticism begins and ends. What\\'s more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.',\n",

Written, directed, shot, scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless Rick Sloane (who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious \"Hobgoblins\"), this horrendously ham-fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way: the excruciatingly lethargic pacing, the painfully static, grainy cinematography (there\\'s a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout), an annoyingly droning and redundant hum\\'n\\'shiver synthesizer score, the flat (non)direction, a tediously talky and uneventful script, the groan-inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, the bloodless murder set pieces, a pitifully unscary killer (he\\'s just some wrinkled-up old guy in pasty make-up), the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters, a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending, and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar. This crud totally lacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy vigor required to be enjoyable junk. Instead it\\'s just a bland, plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a so-shoddy-it\\'s-smoking sort of way.

A couple leave New York city to move in a half star motel room in Maine( for some reason, I just thought of the actors) so the guy ( Don Wood) can write his best selling novel, while his girlfriend works in a library. After they move in, strange things start happening. The feeble attempts to scare you are laughable, if not sad. Of course, the room number is 13, which must have required a great deal of thought for the writer to come up with something so original, and is haunted by a woman who had a relationship with a minister. This movie has a real crappy soundtrack that sounds like a propeller plane, which is really annoying! This film is true proof that they will put anything on DVD.

              "  b\"I thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:<br /><br />First, when Shen told Wendy that he would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay.<br /><br />Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain or go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the eight out of nine suns). Because of his heroic contribution, he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but his wife, Chang-O stole it. After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a hare. She then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version). I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented.<br /><br />The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra-cotta Warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terra-cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is Chinese-American and doesn't have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.<br /><br />The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight... I mean, it's rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.<br /><br />All in all, all of or either of the producer, writer, or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. I would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, I would give it credit (2 stars) for removing one stereotype of Asians and Asian-Americans of being smart and quiet.\",\n",
              "  b\"As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists.<br /><br />We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse.<br /><br />This movie is so bad I wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.\",\n",

A nasty, mean-spirited 'comedy', it's inept on so many levels it beggars belief. John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from Hell, and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. And what the hell's Jack Warden doing in this mess? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity, the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience.

              "  b'\"Going Berserk\" is actually one of the funniest Candy films I have ever seen, period. Sure, it\\'s kinda low budget, but it\\'s a non-stop comedic tour de force. There are tons of memorable quotes. For instance, when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy says \"Oh, I pull down anywhere between thirty and...eleven thousand dollars a year, sir.\" Oh course, it is Candy\\'s delivery that sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker. A clip of his horrible low budget movie \"Kung Fu U\" will have you rolling.<br /><br />So if you are a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can\\'t recommend this movie enough.',\n",

They aren\\'t like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, \"The Partridge Family\").

The original title was \"Johnny Zombie\" (thank God the producers had a change of heart!) I was in the theater scene. I rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters. It is more of a comedy than a horror movie. But... for a good laugh, you might want to check it out. Nothing that is even close to \"Dawn of the Dead\" or even \"Shaun of the Dead\" quality, but the cheese factor is good enough. ciao',\n",
              "  b\"Those who think that Cole Porter and the Cold War make strange bedfellows aren't going to have their minds changed by this movie. It's a bizarre mishmash of MGM kitsch, Red-baiting, and homosexual archness, adapted from the stage musical. It also must be the dullest movie ever made in celebration of fun. I don't know what the stage version did (it's never revived) but this movie has one idea (Communism boring, Capitalism fun!) and it keeps beating us on the head with it while showing us around out a lot of Louis Whatever hotel suites that few Americans in 1957 could afford either. 1...2...3...what are we fighting for! (Money, evidently.) The propaganda would be more persuasive if Charisse didn't look sexier in her Worker's Black Nylons than she does in the silks that mark her transformation from dull comrade to fun capitalist-- and if those silks didn't actually appear to be nylons. <br /><br />For Komic Relief, there are Three Komrades-- they're the Three Stooges. The 'Ninotchka' (Charisse) is innocent of kissing-- she's like the native girls in '30s South Seas flicks. I guess they didn't do THAT behind the Iron Curtain. Perhaps the relevant passages were blacked out of her state translation of THE SUN ALSO RISES. We wait, and wait, and wait while Astaire sings and Janis Paige (she's trying to be Jean Hagen) chews the scenery, for Astaire and Charisse to dance. The dance numbers are very good and show off Astaire's unending quest to try out new ideas. Shame the rest of the movie didn't do so. <br /><br />This period piece is useful as a stored version of the Broadway show but it's watchable only if you occasionally use fast-forward.\",\n",

When it was over, and I had gathered my jaw off the floor, what I believed I'd seen was a wrongheaded attempt at a John Waters movie, without any of the wit or skill. Imagine my surprise to discover this IS a John Waters movie. Where to start? The blank-eyed performances? The screwed-up dualism? The awful editing and pacing? The banal innuendo? The heartless sexual politics? Maybe you need to be American and to have suffered the crazy US religious right to really get this movie - to the rest of us, it feels like someone crossing the street to pee on a Madonna statue... Therapeutic for them but a bit embarrassing if you're with them. The worst thing is, it's almost put me off Chris Isaak for going anywhere near a script this bad. I'll never be able to watch Wicked Game in the same light!\",\n",
              "  b\"Jaws 3-D is a trashy second sequel to Jaws that's more likely to turn viewers' stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat. <br /><br />The premise sees biologists Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong capturing a great white shark to hold at Florida's Seaworld. However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies. Within hours, the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge. <br /><br />Dan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea. Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr. But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down. The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense. The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness. But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame. <br /><br />Fortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm. Its just a big shame that Joe Alves has taken things so far off the rails.\",\n",
              "  b\"- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.\",\n",
              "  b'This is the first of \"The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare\" BBC series I\\'ve seen, and if all of them are like this, I might watch no more. Being practically the full text of the play is everything this \"Romeo & Juliet\" has going for it, lacking in all other departments. Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director, both in the technical and artistic aspects. In the former, because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid. Take in consideration, for example, the badly edited first shot of Abraham and Balthasar in the opening scene, or the Nurse\\'s entering of Friar Lawrence\\'s cell, asking where\\'s Romeo with him being so very in front of her that she\\'d clearly see him even if she was blind. And, in the latter, because every single one of the performers is misdirected, even if some of them are good actors. Rebecca Saire looks exactly the way I\\'ve always imagined Juliet to look like, and she doesn\\'t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager, but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind. Patrick Ryecart as Romeo is even worse, being not only as dull as Juliet, but also way too old and not even good-looking, coming across as a combination of Malcolm McDowell and the Chucky doll. Putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other, let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written. Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader, which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended, no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings. This Tybalt is so mean-looking that we don\\'t believe the characters\\' pity after his demise. As for Paris, I kept thinking of \"Prince Valium\" from Spaceballs. Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.<br /><br />At 168 minutes, this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters, because the characters don\\'t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles. The best screen version is still Franco Zeffirelli\\'s. But, to be fair, this BBC one isn\\'t nearly as bad as abominations like George Cukor\\'s flamboyant geriatric version, or the crime against Humanity that is Baz Luhrmann\\'s feature-length MTV video. 4/10.',\n",

              "  b\"**SPOILERS** A bloody shootout in a Mafia safe-house apartment results in the rip off of $300,000.00 from the mob's Harlam bank. It also cost the lives of seven people including two members of the Mafia Gennaro family. <br /><br />Old Don Gennaro, Frank Macetta, is worried about his operations in Harlem falling apart and has his young hot-shot and sadistic son-in-law Nick D'Salvio, Tony Franciosa,to get things back to normal. Nick starts by trying to get back the stolen loot with the help of the Mafia controlled Doc Johnson, Richard Ward,who runs their Harlem rackets. <br /><br />The three, who knocked off the mob's monthly take, Jim Harris Joe Logart & Henry Jackson, Paul Benjamin Ed Bernard & Antonio Fargas,are marked for death not only by the Mafia and the Jackson Harlem syndicate but by the NYPD. Not just for ripping off the mob but for the murder of two policemen who tried to stop the trio's getaway.<br /><br />Put in charge of the murder/robbery investigation is young and collage educated Let. Poke, Yaphet Kotto, which irritates the local police precincts Capt. Mattelli, Anthony Quinn, who feels he should be the one in charge. This causes friction not only between the two cops but the men of the 27th precinct who feel that Capt. Mattelli should run the investigation.<br /><br />During the movie Capt. Mattelli grudgingly accepts the decision of Let. Poke being put in charge over him since he's been compromised by taking graft from Johnson for years, that will only hamper finding the three hoods who ripped the Johnson/Mafia off. Capt. Mattelli also learns only to late that once your in the pay of the mob the only way you can get out, or retire, of that squalid arraignment is in a pine box.<br /><br />Extremely brutal crime/drama with two of the persons, Henry J. Jackson & Joe Logart, who dared to take the mob's ill-gotten gains ending up viciously tortured and murdered by the maniacal Nick D'Salvio, who took a sick and morbid glee in doing the two in. <br /><br />The third man, and head, of the group of robbers Jim Harris was a lot harder and far more dangerous nut to crack and find by Nick and his hoods. Tracked down in an abandoned building in West Harlem. Jim alone with his common-law wife Gloria,Norma Donaldson, begins to freak-out when he get's epileptic seizures with no medication on hand to relive them. This time thing don't go off that well for Nick and both the Mafia and Johnson mob, like it did with both Joe & Henry. By the time the shootout was over the entire block, where Jim was holding out in, was left shot up and demolished together with Jim Nick and Gloria.<br /><br />Superior crime/movie with a stand-out performance by a young, 34 at the time, Yaphet Kotto as Let. Poke who showed the overly brutal Capt. Mattelli that you don't get the same results in solving crimes with 1940's police tactics in the year 1972. Even more important it's a lot better to be an honest cop then a dirty one in both having a clear conscience and long lifespan.\",\n",

              "  b\"After Zeppo Marx refused to move on with his brothers to MGM from Paramount, the Marxs usually secured the services of another player, usually a singer to function in Zeppo's nondescript place. Usually that person had a lot more personality than Zeppo did. It was Allan Jones in two films, Kenny Baker in one and in The Big Store it was Tony Martin.<br /><br />The still very much alive, but retired Tony Martin, had one of the great voices of the last century. He never made the screen impact that other singers did, though he was in some very good films. His main media outlets were records, radio, and as one of the premier nightclub attractions, especially when he appeared with his second wife Cyd Charisse. Martin had two songs to sing in The Big Store, the much maligned Tenement Symphony and a really nice ballad, If It's You.<br /><br />Martin is the heir to one half of Phelps Department store. The other half is owned by his aunt Margaret Dumont. The Hastings Brothers, who own a chain of department stores, are looking to buy this one. <br /><br />Manager Douglass Dumbrille has been doing a little embezzling on the side and he's afraid that if Martin sells his half, he's taking a stretch up the river. After Martin becomes the victim of an attempted murder, Dumont hires who else, detective Wolf J. Flywheel who is of course Groucho Marx. <br /><br />By a happy coincidence, Groucho has Harpo as a sidekick and Harpo's brother in the film Chico is a friend of Martin's. So now we have all the Marx Brothers working at the store.<br /><br />The Big Store is usually dismissed as one of the Marx Brothers lesser films, but it's always been a favorite of mine. Another reviewer said there were too many musical numbers. I don't think there were any more or less than in other films of their's. The running time is a bit short so it might seem like there's more.<br /><br />The highlight for me is always the final chase seen through the store, especially since Douglass Dumbrille joins in the fun. Dumbrille on screen usually plays some serious villains, probably his best known part is that of Mr. Cedar the lawyer who is milking the estate that Gary Cooper is inheriting in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. <br /><br />Dumbrille is just as successful dealing with the Marx Brothers over embezzlement as he is with Gary Cooper. But here this very serious and obviously classically trained actor joins right in the slapstick fun. Dumbrille looks like he's having a ball. Later on he would really cut loose in a couple of Abbott and Costello films.<br /><br />A question to all movie fans. Who do you think had the most inventive screen character names, W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx?\",\n",
              "  b'There is nothing funny about Funny Games, or at least it wasn\\'t for what I saw. The movie is marketed as an \"important\" social commentary about violence in cinema, but I left the movie without any new information. INstead the movie is a gratuitous torture porn flick that is constantly relentless. The word \"relentless\" is usually associated with movies when giving a positive review. Do not confuse my choice of words as a recommendation of any kind. Relentless it is. Stupid and pointless it is also.<br /><br />The plot is obvious and almost arbitrary. A moderately new family is brutally tortured by two psychotic individuals. They wager a \"bet\" with the captives. The bet: The twisted minds believe they can kill this family before a certain time, while the family believes in survival. Of course, such bet could end with three gunshots at point blank range, but that would be too easy. Literally the largest chunk of the movie involves the family being tortured with random objects. As seen by advertisements, golf clubs are used frequently.<br /><br />Naomi Watts stars and produced this film. Why would she attach herself to such a project? Because while some people will criticize the film for being without any redeeming merits, others will praise the \"originality\" and the \"daring\" aspect involved in creating something so \"deep and meaningful\". I should probably say at this time that this film in question is a shot for shot remake of an 11 year old Austrian version directed by the same individual. So much for originality. So why remake something so soon? Because as we all know, Americans can\\'t enjoy a movie unless it is made domestically. Maybe we should make a commentary about that problem.<br /><br />There is currently a debate about art versus entertainment. It is being suggested that even though the film contains hardly (if any) entertainment value, it should be accepted because of its artistic quality. Call me naive, but I feel that art and entertainment should be mixed. And while some film snobs will suggest that the film is \"complicated\" and needs a high intellect to enjoy, I say that it is too simplistic and predictable. Within the first ten minutes I was very aware of what was to follow. I knew how the ending was going to turn out. The only thing I didn\\'t realize is the amount of manipulation that was to be used. At one point a remote control is used to rewind the action that just happened while the audience is scolded for rooting on the heroine in a violent act that they would have booed for if the villain was the one with an upperhand. The scene is then played out in a now grim way, leading to an ending that is so \"original\".<br /><br />The sad thing about all of this horrible movie is that it is being marketed like a fresh horror satire. Scream was a very good horror satire that accomplished what it set out to do, which was to show the audience how horror films were clich\\xc3\\xa9d, violent and unoriginal without actually producing a clich\\xc3\\xa9d and unoriginal horror film. Without such false advertising, I can\\'t see why anybody would want to watch Funny Games. It promises an explanation for the current audience\\'s fascination of torture porn, but yet resolves to become an exhausting and manipulative torture porn story.<br /><br />The psychopaths (played by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) constantly break the fourth wall in which they want to know what the audience is thinking. They assume that the audience is rooting for Anne, George and little Georgie. I didn\\'t. Forgive me for not caring for one of the dumbest families captured on film. Forgive me for wanting to walk out of this inspired 100 minute rant about violence in cinema. Forgive me for hating Funny Games. Forgive me for advising that you avoid this movie like a plague.<br /><br />Rating: zero stars out of ****',\n",

On the other hand, Ma Wu\\'s makeup (facial hair) is so obviously phony that I simply could not take him seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween, complete with the $4.95 stick-on beard.<br /><br />The special effects were so-so, though the \"undead\" in the cellar were pretty good. The tree-tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick, though the POV shots from the tongue\\'s view more closely resembled Sam Raimi\\'s trademark shots in the more recent \"Evil Dead\" trilogy. The pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get. (In fact, it most closely reminded me of the \"Lost in Space\" episode where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and....) <br /><br />The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense and no plot twists. In fact, you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good, who is bad, and who is going to survive.<br /><br />I just returned this film to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review. The very first thing I did was check the production date. Yep, it says 1987...not the 1967 that I thought it might be. And that pretty much sums it up: The production values and FX are typical of the 1960s. The plot and action seem much older, as Hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s.<br /><br />** out of *****',\n",

              "  b'Like many others, I was very interested in this remake of \"The Lathe of Heaven,\" for several reasons. The book by Ursula K. LeGuin is widely regarded as a science-fiction classic, although I have never thought it was among her best work. I read it after I saw the first \"Lathe of Heaven\" on PBS in 1980 and realized that considerable liberties had been taken with the story, although it was much closer to the book than this latest endeavor.<br /><br />Back then, \"Lathe\" was a bold experiment for PBS and the producers: To make an original full-length science-fiction TV movie on a limited budget that would appeal to an audience used to flashier entertainment. Remember, it was only three years since \"Star Wars\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" had revitalized screen science fiction, until then very much in the doldrums. The producers of LOH wanted to make a more intimate story than those blockbuster movies, one based more on human relationships. With their low budget, they looked for places and expedients that would transmit their vision. Although the story was set in Portland, Oregon, they filmed a lot of it in Dallas because of that city\\'s more futuristic architecture. I liked it very much and videotaped it, and have the tape to this day. (Unfortunately but inevitably, the tape had deteriorated significantly when I transferred it to DVD at the end of 2006. Never fear, it appears that it\\'s now available on commercial DVD.)<br /><br />It says a great deal about inflation in the movie business that the remake had a \"small\" budget of \"only\" $5 million. That would have been a lot of money for the original filmmakers. I also wonder why here in the States we had to wait until September of 2002 to see it when the first comments about it, from a viewer in Turkey, are from February!<br /><br />But whenever it aired, my reaction would be the same: Why did they bother to make it at all? There is so little of the original here that it is essentially a different work. They have taken the story and drained it of its blood. And what does happen goes beyond problems with temporal discontinuities and paradoxes; these people behave without logic or motivation. It looks like a long episode of the \"new\" Outer Limits or a similar show, one of those low-budget syndicated series that they film in Canada because it\\'s cheaper there, where there is money only for a few sets, a couple of computer graphics, and a lot of talk in closeup (to hide the spareness of the sets). All of the acting and dialogue takes place in murmurs. I usually like James Caan, but it looks like he\\'s been watching Bruce Willis\\'s recent film work and decided to try the minimalist, non-acting approach.<br /><br />Now that I\\'ve brought up The Outer Limits, remember how the opening credits used to talk about \"awe and mystery\"? Well, if you want awe and mystery, forget about this remake and go back to the 1980 version; it had much more of those qualities.',\n",

To become a master ninja he must conquer his self doubt, and in fitting fashion there is a showdown in which he proves himself, and wins back the woman. All of this is embellished around superb acting, action packed choreography, a disregard for continuity, and a highly stylized joie de vivre thats quite personal, fans of Hicks know what I mean.<br /><br />The dialog is all over dubbed, and the OST pushes the story along backed to a clich\\xc3\\xa9 80's glam sound. What is not too love about this movie?... I used to think Hitchcock was a master, then I saw what Bill Hicks could do.\",\n",

              "  b\"The Elephant Man is one of my favorite films. The film's main highlight is the incredible performance by John Hurt. It is heartbreaking and touching at the<br /><br />same time. Some of the scenes in the film are incredibly hard to watch, when the worst of humankind is shown being as cruel as possible. As a result you may<br /><br />find The Elephant Man depressing, however, I see it on the contrary. I find the film to be a brilliant, touching work portraying a man desperately trying to be accepted in a prejudiced society. Watch it and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, don't mind the fact that Mel Brooks produced. He actually had his name removed from the credits, fearing that the public would not take the movie seriously if his name was there. It is NOT a Mel Brooks- type movie.\",\n",

However don't be disappointed if the quality is not as high as Fares's debut.<br /><br />It's more filled with stupid jokes and the characters are not as thoroughly deepened as you would like. On the other hand, the plot (paper thin as it may be) very original and you feel good by it. Moreover the special effects are unexpectedly good for a swedish film. It may be clear that I liked this one very much and I can really recommend it! ...\",\n",
              "  b'Larry Fessenden\\'s \"The Last Winter\" is a ambitious and smartly made film. It\\'s photographed beautifully and (by and large) acted with conviction and sensitivity. Though the central conceit about nature \"taking revenge\" is pretty corny, the atmosphere is also pretty compellingly bleak, and the tension mounts pretty effectively as things go from bad to worse. Sadly, as many other reviewers note, the ending throws it all away in a fit of awful CG monsters.<br /><br />However, try turning it off right at one hour 27 minutes and 30 seconds. This would have been a solid albeit ambiguous ending; if you must watch further do it on a second viewing and consider it a deleted ending. It\\'s just goofy and pointless, and the final \"twist\" at the end is telegraphed almost from the very beginning (in fact, one character early on describes aloud exactly what the twist will end up being).<br /><br />Even without the ending, the script has problems with its petty black-and-white portrayal of heroic environmentalist and selfish oil guy. An ensemble atmosphere pic like this lives and dies on the believability of its characters; Perlman\\'s Ed Pollock is simply too villainous to really be convincing, despite a few nice touches of humanity which Perlman brings to him. Le Gros\\' Hoffman is also a pretty unengaging hero, a blandly heroic saint of a guy who\\'s always right about everything. I\\'m a serious environmentalist and a left-leaning guy, but the film\\'s literal take on the situation (the dire warnings of natural disaster, the clear heroes and villains) is shallow at best and preachy and patronizing at the worst. It plays to the most obnoxiously self-congratulatory nature of people concerned with the issues presented here, while at the same time offering nothing of any real substance.<br /><br />Still, the film itself is a pretty fun watch, and a definite step up from Fessenden\\'s previous effort, the ambitious but amateurish \"Wendigo\" (the titular spirit of which gets name-checked here too!). Great photography combined with naturalistic acting from the likes of Kevin Corrigan and Zach Gilford do much to sell the vibe of the thing, and the setting and slow escalation of the action also add to the experience. Regardless of its stumbles, the film has loads of ambition to do something substantial and enduring, so even when it can\\'t quite deliver on its promise it still beats the slew of cheap-scare horror remakes which every year become more numerous.',\n",
              "  b'The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it...or me. It is not a good movie. Terrible in fact. But terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. It would have made a great MST3K subject!<br /><br />Most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contrived plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You\\'ll thrill to slo-mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off, but WHO\\'S SHOT? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one finally goes down. You\\'ll sing along (in latin of course) with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death\\'s-choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical.<br /><br />So if you believe like I do that as movies get worse they get better, then this might be a decent choice for you. It\\'s not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, \"They Live\" featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it\\'s more fun to watch than luke-warm movies like Omen II or III.<br /><br />I give it 4 out of 10.',\n",

My Favorite actor in Subway Stories actually was Danny Hoch. I\\'m not even sure why, I think it was because he was cool and laid back. Where as his friend was very hype kind of rowdy and a little drunk. But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well. I also think it was the best story out of all ten stories, which is called \"HONEY GETTER\". The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting. I checked out all the scenes where the stories were shot, and it kind of Felt as if I was in the movie it self, feeling weird like I was in my own little world. Another thing I did was went to the spot where the movie first comes on from the blimp look. It took me a while to find it bit I finally did, and the spot that they show or I should say the view is just right above Union Square. Because if you look real carefully at your tv, you\\'ll notice the foot locker and the dirt on the side which I believe now is a movie theatre called United Artists. Well that pretty much concludes my little story and I enjoyed sharing, I hope maybe you\\'ll notice something in the movie I didn\\'t.

              "  b\"If you enjoy writing your congressman to complain about black helicopters, you'll love the Panama Deception.<br /><br />Though this movie did a masterful job of deceiving the Motion Picture Academy and many of those who viewed the film, the film is nothing more than an anti-American propaganda piece. The claims of mass civilian killings have crumbled under the slightest scrutiny, and the premise of the film is widely rejected not only by Americans familiar with the decision making process involved in choosing to invade the country, but by every Panamanian national I've ever met - regardless of socioeconomic status.<br /><br />I travel regularly to Panama and have had the fortune to develop strong relationships with Panamanian nationals. After hundreds of conversations and interaction in virtually every facet of daily life with Panamanians, I've yet to encounter a hint of regret for the U.S. invasion. The truth is that Panama labored under a dictator whose thirst for power and disregard for political dissent grew to an unacceptably dangerous point.<br /><br />But even if your politics won't permit you to agree with my comments above, you would acquit yourself well to ask why the U.S. honored the Panama Canal Treaties and handed over full control of the Canal in 1999. The central premise of The Panama Deception is that the U.S. sought to destroy the Panama Defense Forces in order to thwart handover of the Canal to Panama in accordance with the treaties signed by President Carter in the late 1970s. And yet, the U.S. closed its military bases, and today Panama is one of the most robust democracies in the Western Hemisphere and operates the Canal in sovereign fashion.\",\n",
              "  b'Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.<br /><br />Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. And all of that doesn\\'t even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) <br /><br />Ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable \"twist\") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another \"twist.\" It\\'s all totally mechanical, right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about.)',\n",

Two, it is one of only about a dozen filmed appearances of big band great Jimmmy Dorsey, who performs, with his band, a number called John Silver (\"15 men on a dead man\\'s chest\") which I haven\\'t found elsewhere, and a few other songs. Three, the \"Pokomoko\" routine (\"Slowwwwly I turned, step by step I crept upon him . . .\") is done to perfection by A&C with Murray Leonard as the Derelict, which I\\'ve always remembered as one of my favorite A&C routines since I was ten years old. Furthermore, there\\'s a real live giant (Lock Martin), full costumes and exotic sets as you would expect from MGM, a magic skit by A&C, hypnotism, a fine performance from Douglas Dumbrille as the bad guy, and more good music. I would rate it below Abott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, In The Navy, In Society, The Naughty Nineties, and perhaps 3 or 4 others, but definitely in their top ten or twelve. But since it\\'s not in the Universal set, it\\'s not available on DVD anywhere.',\n",

              "  b\"Cutting Class is a late eighties slasher flick that delivers on the most pathetic of levels. It actually has a good cast featuring Jill Schoelen, Brad Pitt, Roddy McDowell and Donovan Leitch. But even with these actors the movie is a complete failure, in my opinion.<br /><br />Leitch plays the part of Brian who has been released from a psychiatric ward for murdering his Father fives years ago. Upon return to School, his old friend Dwight (Pitt) decides he would rather humiliate him than to be his friend again. Jill Schoelen plays Paula who is Dwights girlfriend and is the love interest of Brian, also. Suddenly, teachers and students are turning up missing or dead and it comes down to whether Brian is the killer or Dwight is the killer.<br /><br />I saw this film many years ago and had trouble sitting through it then. I don't know why things would be different now. The script is laughable and the actors try to do their best but still turns out bad. What Roddy McDowell is doing in this movie playing a perverted principal is beyond me. Such a great actor and to end up in trash like this is just sad. The actor that does the best with his character is Brad Pitt. He does a surprisingly decent job. The murder scenes are extremely weak with a few off screen killings and one killing with a very fake ax to the head. Just disappointing... 3/10\",\n",

              "  b\"First of all, I must say that I am no anime expert. My entire knowledge of the genre is limited to the more famous Miyazaki films, 'Ghost in the Shell' and its sequel, and now the beautiful, dark, tragic 'Elfen Lied'.<br /><br />The story centers around Lucy, a girl born with a genetic mutation which gave her horns and 'vectors' - powerful telekenetically controlled arms. The first time we meet her, she is cold-bloodedly killing soldiers and office workers in what appears to be a strange research facility. A sniper succeeds in shooting her in the head, ending her rampage. However, he fails to kill her: she falls into the sea surrounding the facility, and is later found washed up on the beach by two cousins. However, this is not the Lucy we saw spilling so much blood - the shot left her with severe amnesia, turning her into the innocent, childlike Nyuu. When an assassin and later another being of her kind are sent to destroy her, we witness the murderous Lucy emerging once more, only to transform back into Nyuu once the violence is over. As the series progresses, we gradually learn about Lucy's horrific past, finally leaving us with the dilemma: Were her brutal actions perhaps in any way justified? <br /><br />Elfen Lied is dark, that I will not deny. Lovers of light, happy entertainment will be disappointed and very likely offended. The series deals with all the darker aspects of humanity: the practice of alienating those who are different, murder, cruel experimentation, sexual abuse, sadism, torture, and even genocide or 'purifying the earth'. As the story progresses, we find that virtually all the main characters have experienced one or more of these, and much of the series focuses on their attempts to somehow cope with the trauma; to pick up the pieces.<br /><br />Which brings me on to the violence. Elfen Lied is decidedly not a series for the faint-hearted. We watch bodies being torn in half, children being dismembered, and one scene of horrific animal cruelty. However, throughout the series, I do not remember one act of violence that seemed in any way 'trashy' or unnecessary. This is no gore-fest made to entertain teenage males. What is often even more disturbing than the violence itself, are the emotions attached to it. Also, some of the most violent scenes are rather surreal: think characters being tortured to eerily beautiful Gregorian chants.<br /><br />The major characters of Elfen Lied are highly memorable: sinning and sinned-against Lucy and her touchingly loving alter ego Nyuu; endearingly awkward Kohta who continuously battles his feelings for her but has painful repressed memories; his cousin Yuka who many reviewers have branded as 'irritating' but is really a somewhat unsettling reflection of the jealousy that turned Lucy into a killer; lovable Nana who is basically Lucy without the violent side; and Mayu, the abuse victim whose story of recovery is one of the most uplifting in the series. I would also like to mention Mariko, a minor character but still my personal favourite: she is a young girl who has the same mutation as Lucy, who does horrific things to people with the air of a child burning ants with a magnifying glass.<br /><br />In conclusion, Elfen Lied is a mature and deep series which can be enjoyed on so many levels: from an action horror story to a philosophical debate on what it means to be human. The execution is exquisite, with images that linger in the mind for a long time. All in all, I recommend Elfen Lied to anyone with an open mind, a strong stomach, and a willingness to try something different.\",\n",
              "  b\"DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART (Bin Lim Mai Ching)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Betrayed and left for dead by a gangster's duplicitous moll (Gigi Lai), a hired assassin (Daniel Wu) undergoes plastic surgery to remove the facial deformity which has marginalized him throughout his life, then returns to Hong Kong to take revenge against Lai and her associates.<br /><br />Amateurish exploitation thriller, plotted to labyrinthine excess by an uncredited scriptwriter, and directed with a breathtaking lack of conviction by sleaze specialist Billy Chung (notorious for a string of gruesome shockers, most notably the Anthony Wong vehicle LOVE TO KILL, made in 1993). Sex and violence appear to be the principal focus of Chung's attentions in DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART, but while the sex angle is exploited for all it's worth - Lai lounges around in revealing designer outfits whilst never quite managing to get completely naked - the film's violence appears to have been curtailed in post-production for a less restrictive censor rating. Wu struggles gamely under Chung's ham-fisted direction, playing the role of vengeful loner with his usual quiet dignity (cameraman Ally Wong spends as much time leering over Wu's beauty as Lai, which evens things up a little), while co-star Stephen Fung lurks around the periphery as an obsessed cop determined to uncover Wu's true identity and establish his connection (if any) to the murder of Fung's partner (Sam Lee, in a cameo appearance). Experienced character actor Lam Suet (ONE NITE IN MONGKOK) is Wu's loyal brother, David Lee plays Lai's lowlife gangster rival, and Convoy Chan is the boyfriend whom Lai throws to the wolves with sadistic glee.<br /><br />There's a juicy melodrama struggling to emerge from this artless enterprise, but the film plays like a cheap imitation of a HK crime thriller, lacking the sincerity and craftsmanship which has distinguished the former colony's cinematic output for decades. Clearly intended for a quick theatrical play-off before heading straight to video, DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART wastes a terrific premise and top-notch cast. Still watchable, if only for the pairing of Wu and Fung, but they deserve miles better than this throwaway effort. Dreadful, interminable music score by Tommy Wai.<br /><br />(Cantonese and Mandarin dialogue)\",\n",
              "  b\"I've seen the film AND read the play, which I think makes me unique. It also makes me queasy. The word `queasy' is not a staple of my vocabulary, for some reason, but it leapt readily to mind as a precise description of how this miserable, grotty-looking, dull, funny-as-chloroform movie made me feel, and will make you feel, too, if you're not careful. The play was little more than a foray into a now extinct breed of artiness. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that it has never been produced anywhere in the world since 1970 - and hopefully, the sun will grow cold before it is produced anywhere ever again. The film is a botched version of the play, AND a foray into extinct artiness in its own right. Moreover I think something was wrong with the film stock. The very colours upset my stomach.<br /><br />Here is what remains of the plot synopsis, excluding that which has been so wittily summed up by the title: a widow has had her dead husband stuffed; she lugs his preserved corpse around wherever she travels; she has an idiot son who is sort of undergoing a sexual awakening (DON'T expect anything salacious); and that's about it. Every so often the dead father will appear in a little bubble in the top right-hand corner of the screen and comment on what, if anything, is going on. Sometimes he'll talk to his son. Sometimes he'll address the audience, with lines like, `Not much will happen in the next few minutes.' If he'd been honest, he would have added, `And not much will happen after that, either, so if you're thinking of walking out, cut your losses and do so NOW.'<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - the 1960s was the tail end of Hollywood's golden age, producing delightful throw-backs like **** and stunning new masterpieces like ****. (I'm sorry - I simply couldn't bear to see the names of two of my favourite films associated in any way with this one.) But it was also the Decade of Floundering. If you want to see just how badly Hollywood was floundering in the 'sixties, by all means watch this movie - but you'll probably decide that you didn't really want to know, after all.\",\n",

If you can buy that, you will probably be able to handle the rest of the movie as well. \"Shark Attack\" tells the story of Van Dien going to South Africa (where just about everyone seem to be a hustler), to look for his missing friend. He finds out that his friend became shark food, and tries to find out why the sharks have started to behave so aggressively in this particular area. He gets help by another expert, Corinne, who loves to run around in her bikini while trying to solve the case.<br /><br />If you are looking for really bad acting, check out \"Shark Attack\". You won\\xc2\\xb4t believe your eyes. The effects are awfully lousy, unless you find rubber sharks convincing. The script contained so many old cliches that I lost count of them, and that is not too good. Right from the start it is quite obvious who is good and who is evil.<br /><br />These kind of films can be so bad that they become entertaining, but \"Shark Attack\" is not fun at all. Man, I\\xc2\\xb4d rather watch an episode of \"Baywatch\" than this kind of crap.

How can anyone even believe that an utterly fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place, would influence the events in this movie? I know that its B-grade, low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through. It just does'nt make sense.

              "  b\"The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read 'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego'.<br /><br />It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?' moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn't There, What Would Jesus Buy, or the soon-to-be released Religulous.<br /><br />Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.\",\n",
              "  b'Most of the movie is sadly rather underdone. Seems they had a somewhat interesting concept and just rushed it to the finish line. I am guessing they thought of the ending first and wrote a bunch of filler to get to said ending. So what do we get for most of the film? A rather good cast doing nothing more than going out to the abandoned town and getting themselves kidnapped by the evil cult led by Ernest Borgainine in a rather good over the top performance. You know a movie is in trouble when it seems they are rushing things so no startling revelations here, only lets rush to the cool ending. Which is the highlight of the film, a rain that comes down and washes the cult members away, rather good effects, especially for the time, but this does not make up for the rest of the film. Which leads to a question I have, why are movies about Satan and his cults usually so bloody boring or bad for the most part? You would think these movies would be some of the most gory and scary the horror genre had to offer, but usually it falls flat. Still if you do watch the movie look out for the many stars who apparently had nothing else better to do.',\n",
              "  b'As a young black/latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I didn\\'t. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a film like \"Raising Victor\" over this one any day. I just was not too impressed.',\n",
              "  b'I was four years old in 1977 and I saw \"Star Wars\" in the theater. Let me be very clear: I\\'m a huge SW fan, but that doesn\\'t mean that I see the prequel trilogy as a great experience in movie-making. I do, however, believe that \"Clone Wars\" is simply excellent. The animation style, the pacing, the story. It\\'s all there.<br /><br />My jaw dropped when Anakin and Ventress fought on Yavin IV for the very simple fact that they were fighting in a thunderstorm. No one has ever visualized the simplicity of a lightsaber battle where raindrops are hitting the blades and sizzling as soon as they make contact. That one idea shows to me that the animators are looking for something beyond the typical SW experience, and they found it.<br /><br />Yes, you do have to get used to the visuals, as they do look like \"Samurai Jack\" (but, being a \"Samurai Jack\" fan, I think that\\'s a good thing). And, if you watched them as they originally aired, you had to watch them in five minute increments for Volume One and 20 minute increments for Volume Two, which could throw you off in terms of the pacing (though, again, I thought they did it very, very well and that the way the chapters aired made perfect sense).<br /><br />In the end, there is a 120+ minute SW movie (basically Episode II and 1/2) between the two volumes of the DVDs. It shows Anakin and Padme\\'s romance in ways that Lucas couldn\\'t get across, it allows us to see Anakin become a Jedi Knight, and it gives some great insight into not only the prequel trilogy but also the classic one.<br /><br />If you even have the slightest interest in SW, these two DVDs are time and money well spent.',\n",
              "  b'Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe \"How to lose friends & alienate people\". The underlying romance in the plot is, for the most part, displaced by a far more interesting \"rags to riches\" tale. Although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed, in several screen shots, it does have a sense of; getting the \"nitty gritty\" out of the way, focusing on those key relationships which make \"office politics\" and using those almost irrelevant scenes, used purely for comic effect. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately very clever, playing well on the trans-Atlantic relationship Pegg shares with his co-stars and merging the cross between the high and low -life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey. The different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film. Both the \"trading places\" relationship between Pegg and Huston and the \"love, hate\" relationship between Pegg and Dunst do work so well in a story that is, for want of a better word, charming. Even Fox, whose main asset is of course sex appeal, shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that \"bimbo\" role all to well. Its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work. From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy.',\n",

It\\'s an insult to the great state of Maine. Also, the one girl says she\\'s going to Boston College and will be moving to Newton, which she describes as \"south of Boston.\" No, it\\'s not.

This review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch. If anyone is considering watching it or buying it I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons.

With the aid of metal-head Jose Maria(played by Santiago Segura) and the fake psychic Professor Cavas(played superbly by Armando De Razza), he goes on his quest to kill the baby before the anti-Christ\\'s reign begins.<br /><br />The story is filled with very dark humor as the priest has to sin in order for him to be convincing enough as a satanist. Alex Angulo really carries the film and gives a great performance, but is Armando De Razza who steals the show; Cavas and his girlfriend(played by beautiful Maria Grazia Cucinotta) have a great scene and Maria shines on her small role as the dumb blonde who dates Cavas.<br /><br />De la Iglesia takes us on the roller-coaster that is this movie, as it never drags and goes on with a fast-paced rhythm. A great camera-work makes the film even better and the bizarre beauty of it\\'s photography, contrasting the colorful Christmas with the dark gritty violence of the streets of Madrid.<br /><br />Overall a near-perfect film, \"El D\\xc3\\xada de la Bestia\" will keep you entertained with it\\'s irreverent(some would say blasphemous) dark humor.<br /><br />10/10.

This totally undid any weight or consequence or plot the film had for me.<br /><br />Looking at their book they knocked up a first draft in a month or so and were shooting I think two months after that. They should have got feedback/reviews and done subsequent drafts and sorted that problem out first IMHO before shooting. It's was no surprise then to me that Mirimax and others wouldn't distribute it, and the offers they got were so small.<br /><br />I guess I'm not saying a film like this is wrong - just that it has extremely low appeal.

Before then, I was only marginally interested in films. Something to while away the time. And then I saw Satyricon. And life has never been the same ever since. All of a sudden I realised that film was more than simply recording images, all of a sudden it dawned on me that cinema could be art. Now, maybe Satyricon isn't great art, but to me at that time it was overwhelming. I'm sure other films have had this same catalytic effect on other people. Satyricon got me hooked on film, and I never looked back. I saw the film again about 10 years ago. I was amazed how it was still capable of exiting me. In spite of its wooden acting, its cardboard backgrounds, the unsynchronized lip movements this is amazing movie magic.\",\n",
              "  b\"I never read or watched the original Astro Boy but I hope its better than this astrological unlikeable and generic CGI movie. Overall, the movie felt forced: so much happens in this hour and a half movie that there is no time to develop anything or even the hundreds of moral themes the movie throws at the audience (law of robotics, being human, finding where you belong).<br /><br />Oddly enough, the movie has a weird good guy/bad guy bipolar disorder where characters turn from being a good guy to a bad guy back to a good guy in a matter of minutes. Case in point: the second act builds heavily on Ham Egg being portrayed as a replacement fatherly figure and an all around good guy but all of a sudden, he turns on Astro Boy with no justification since his introduction. <br /><br />Animation wise, I thought the movie had no real distinct style and it felt like I was watching Robots but I found it odd that character design of Astro Boy looked completely different from all the other characters. He still had the anime look with big eyes yet the other characters looked like generic cgi characters. <br /><br />It's a shame because I wanted this movie to be better. In the end, Astro Boy is completely forgettable.\",\n",
              "  b\"First of all, I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american. Sure, there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly, like at the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they aren't naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this, for example.<br /><br />But returning to the film itself, what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it. We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.<br /><br />All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th. Thus, what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks, and this may make some people infuriated; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies, regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.<br /><br />Finally, I think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened, and this movie could give some clues to them. This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future, and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today.\",\n",

              "  b'Mifune is in my top five movies. I have probably watched this movie over three hundred times, and every time I am delighted by a small detail: the camera angle, the dialog, the consistency, the absolutely beautiful setting. The script/story is full of a vibrancy and living in a such a simple and classy way that you can\\'t help but smile and believe in the immortality of these characters throughout human time, to be played out over and over again. And thus revealing the truth of the matter of love. Iben Hjejle, who plays Liva, is gorgeous and natural, an amazing amazing actress. She shines like the sun because she is allowed to. You can see she was allowed to \"play\" this character as she felt, and with heart. Anders Berthelsen, who plays Kresten, really absorbs the character, becoming this man who has survived the farm and made it to the top of monetary success, but finds love in the land and in Liva, as well as his brother Rud. Rud, played by Jesper Asholt, has to be the secret genius of this film. Every moment of every shot he is the gentle loving giant child. One actor who is going to be a huge success is Emil Tarding, who plays Liva\\'s little brother Bjarke. What a smart clever funny young man. They all shine because of the writing, first and foremost, and because of the Dogma rules, second. Dogma is a revolution, pure, true, allowing movement and flow, like a mountain river in comparison to a polluted ditch, making it hard to watch our American 100 million dollar movies with any respect. Mifune is personal. It is obvious there was a small crew. One gaffer for example, so that it\\'s as if you are there, the only one, inside the story, watching like a fly on the wall, enjoying the struggle through the confusion of life, as everyone. A massive crew of hundreds disturbs the acting, disturbs the vibe, becomes the movie, rather then the film being the focus. Somehow these larger and larger films just become money vampires for people to fill their bank accounts, rather then go to make something beautiful, as this. Anyway, one can see in watching this film how a movie should really \"feel.\" You can understand that the actors felt comfortable and the whole thing came very naturally for them, rather then forced. One can immediately understand that the director Soren K. Jacobson was excited and felt the artist, allowing himself the opportunity to touch base with why we make films in the first place, art. When I get sick of Hollywood films (every other day) I watch Mifune and feel refreshed and I believe in the poetry of film once again. I can believe that a simple story is capable of being entertainment and moving, rather then great big complicated stories that consume the characters, and miss the mark.',\n",
              "  b'Two questions arise when watching a film mixing these 2 genres. First, what makes anyone think these 2 can be compatible or symbiotic? On the contrary, they are mutually exclusive except in rare cases - \"Home, Sweet Homicide\" is an exception which comes to mind. For the most part the components of the one nullify those of the other.<br /><br />Second, what were the qualifications for a screenwriter in the 30\\'s? This picture had some of the lamest dialogue and contained so many non-sequiturs that much of the plot was unintentionally funny and many gag lines fell completely flat. On the whole it made little sense and was a chore to watch.<br /><br />Saving grace here was the surprisingly able cast and better-than average screen credits which signified a superior production - but which was wrecked by and uninteresting final product. I gave this one a rating of 3 and it was richly deserved.',\n",

              "  b'I had never seen (or heard of) this flick before last night, when it aired on TCM. This movie is like a strange, experimental post-hippie-era bad dream. I\\'m not sure what to make of it, actually. 5 minutes into it, I knew it was going to be bad (or \"bad\") in a good way, and was resentful that I was gonna have to sit through the entire thing to let the Gnosis sink in. But by the end, I was glad I had. This flick is truly creepy, without (I think?) intending to be creepy (or as creepy as it actually wound up being, since the movie DID bill itself as a \"grim fairy tale\"). Some very surreal elements (perhaps \"unlikely\" or \"poorly scripted\" masquerading as \"surreal\"): ex.: the bikers carrying their dead companion, funeral-procession-like, into a house they\\'ve never been in. Other creepy elements: corpses being made to blow out birthday cake candles for a young girl (as if anyone would want a cake with corpse-breath all over it) and, shortly thereafter, the same corpse inadvertently cutting off its own finger while slicing the cake. Some of the \"reanimation\" scenes are truly amazing and freaky: bodies rising from the ground at the oddest angles, seemingly defying the law of gravity (part of the mime\\'s craft in the film: kudos) with arms and legs askew- quite amazing to watch. I\\'ll cut this short, but I was very glad I was able to accidentally catch this movie last night, and I would definitely recommend it to fans of oddball cinema, mimes, zombies, puppets, or William Castle. PS- the peculiar ending of the movie (suggested by the beginning) made me like it even more. And I would normally have given this movie an 8 on its own merits, but for being so absurdly original, I gave it an extra point. Ta.',\n",

The goat was nahing while the guy was pretending to grind on it. I would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (not the one with the goat though). Jane Ryall who played Celia only did this one film. She was very nude throughout. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. I almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners. If you like crazy off the wall stuff, then this is your film. 3/10\",\n",

I am not even exaggerating when I say that it really is possible that this is the worst show that has ever been put on TV. I know that if you went through every show ever made in the world you would probably find some old shows from the 1970s or something made in Croatia with a budget of about five dollars that are maybe even worse but considering the quality of shows we have in North America and the fact there is a real budget, etc, with this show being available in like thirty million homes, then the amount that this show was a total fail really becomes apparent. Those who have seen this show know what I mean. The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was. Worst TV host ever, worst interviews, worst guests, worst sketches, worst on screen talent, worst acting, worst writing, worst directing, worst overall production.

If I was the US navy representative I would have said \"excuse me Hun, we didn\\'t come here looking for you\" I think it\\'s funny how Professor Aronax wrote books about the sea, but he never was beneath the waves, and must have based his knowledge of the sea on other peoples work.<br /><br />Disappointed(** out of ****)',\n",

The sets are elaborate, everything looks perfect and this was the first film with an all star cast. The script is sharp and the direction moves the story along. Garbo and Crawford are just superb--they\\'re so young and full of life! They play their roles to perfection.<br /><br />But there is one big problem here--the male actors. To put it kindly they\\'re pretty bad. John Barrymore looks like he\\'s a million miles away; his brother Lionel overacts to an embarrassing degree (and gets very annoying) and Berry chews the scenery. They weaken what could have been a great movie. As it stands I can only give it an 8--but it\\'s still well worth seeing. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1932.',\n",
              "  b\"Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s, and the one that put him on the map. The scale of this self-directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished. There are, clearly, differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions, with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trial\\xc2\\x97at the time, trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese!<br /><br />Nonetheless, Chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible, so non-Cantonese audiences don't miss much. It's not, after all, the dialogue that makes a Chan flick, but the action and the painful out-takes. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun), and assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is superb from beginning to end, and there's not much time to breathe in between. It'll never get you thinking, but what an entertaining, and well strung-together, film. Arguably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there.\",\n",

Anyone who is looking to be uplifted, touched, and inspired, no mater their religious affiliation, this is the film for you. Coming from Idaho Falls, Idaho myself this film has a soft spot for me. The touching moments, the harsh reality of prejudice, and the outcome of honest sacrifice makes this film profound. This film is a true story that shows only a few of his vast adventures, which change his life. He gave up his home, family, love, comforts, and all that was familiar for almost three years to help people he had never met. This truly shows you don't need to die to 'lay down ones life', but better yet, it's the putting aside our worldly desires for things of a better.<br /><br />Have a very critical eye, being a director and writer myself, I say this film is a success.\",\n",

The plot makes virtually zero sense and half of it (the Shield) is both scientifically impossible AND utterly unnecessary. There are broad, hammy performances, jarring leaps, and inconsistencies by the carload. And has anyone got any idea how/why the Zeistians ever evolved their bizarre immortality code? If I ever make a list of the ten most jaw-droppingly stupid movies, this will definitely be there. BUT....<br /><br />I give it a three [and not a two or below] solely for the charm and humor of Sean Connery's performance as Ramirez. Unlike others who, having apparently decided to play their roles here for laughs, went totally overboard into eye-rolling panic or guffawing villainy --Connery plays every one of his scenes in this strange new century with delightful lightness and panache. Whether gracefully bowing out of a stage performance of HAMLET, paying off a snooty men's tailor with his pearl earring, experiencing his first airplane ride (a wonderful sequence!) or giving his life to save MacLeod & girl from a Nameless Evil Machine, Connery is the definition of the gallant cavalier, and saves what otherwise would be an unsavable film. I salute him.<br /><br />Watch it for him if you think you can stand the rest of it....\",\n",

It had a good, interesting story and great characters. The special effects were pretty good too. Even though the lead character is a young kid, it was OK since all of the characters and story were realistic and serious - and not depicted from a kid\\'s point of view.<br /><br />The story is framed around a modern-day pub where an old-timer is telling a couple young hikers/travelers the story of a picture on the wall.

Each character has his or her own theme and that\\'s that. There are no character developments or even a care to it. It just seem that they had a cool outline for a movie and decided to put them in without any consideration to a story.<br /><br />Just so you know, it\\'s not very hard to be a Seeker in this movie. He goes back in time when he sees a sign. He doesn\\'t even need to know what time period, his seeker abilities take care of that for him. Not only do they take him back in time, but he hallucinates the symbol for the \"light\" wherever a sign is located. So his job is to be involuntarily transported back in to to an empty room, see a transparent symbol and put his hand where it was. That\\'s it. \"I never thought you would get this far.\" You\\'ve got to be kidding! This movie plays out like a little kid\\'s video game!<br /><br />The villain is the complete opposite of intimidating, every time he is on screen I chuckled. His weapon of choice? Crows. Yes, that\\'s right, you read that correctly. He uses crows to attack people. Yeah, he\\'s here to destroy all light on the planet and he uses crows to scratch people. Yes, this makes me very scared indeed. <br /><br />The camera tries to make the movie seem like there is action about to happen, but after the third time of these \"action\" sequences that end in a protracted dialog that was, \"Give me the signs boy!\" \"No, I won\\'t!\" \"Fine, Have it your way\" you laugh at the bad guy for his terrible aptitude for being a bad guy and how easy it is to defy this evil power. Then the villain rides off into the distance. It just never made ANY sense. This movie is probably the worst film of the millennium.',\n",
              "  b\"City Hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country, state or any sort of major political table. Granted it shines on New York City which is a huge political arena, especially nowadays, but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor's right hand. Director Harold Becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising, Malice, and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault. I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama, not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out...what else...or rather who else...Al Pacino. The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city. As the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss, and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city. As events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up.<br /><br />I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino. I mean even if ONCE he didn't give a good performance how could I ever say it? The man is acting royalty. There is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor. In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor. He has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician. He also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches I've ever seen at the 'James Bone' Funeral. I re-watched that speech four times and the first time I watched Pacino give it, my mouth gaped open and I almost wanted to stand up and applaud. Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino. John Cusack, who I really do enjoy as an actor, turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun. He is kind of the focus of the film and him and Pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance...he seems like he's trying too hard. His accent is just bizarre, and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn't get seem to pull it off. Maybe he was having an off film. Bridget Fonda, on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows Marybeth Cogan. Her performance is very similar to Cusack's in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character. Danny Aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia Frank Anselmo. Martin Landau makes a decent cameo as Judge under scrutiny Walter Stern.<br /><br />The problem with City Hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors. Everyone is...okay. There is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy. And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film. It almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them. So City Hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one BUT it still has to be seen for Pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics. If you just won't see this movie than find Pacino's speech at James Bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes Al Pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it. If you're a John Cusack fan which I am...he's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice. A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss. 7.5/10\",\n",
              "  b'I just noticed that \"Melvin and Howard\" registered a mere 6.6 on the IMDb rating scale. Don\\'t you believe it! This is a great American movie. Director Demme and writer Goldman take a footnote to history -- a contested Howard Hughes will that named Melvin Dummar, a milkman who once loaned him a quarter, as one of his heirs -- and turn that slight material into a wry meditation on the American Dream. Or more specifically, the thin line that separates the American Dream from pure hell. Demme has a great eye for people like Dummar, a dreamer whose clock for realizing his dreams is winding down. The performances are terrific, especially Paul Le Mat as Dummar (whatever happened to Le Mat?) and Mary Steenburgen who won an Oscar for playing his wife. Jason Robards does one of his patented cameos playing a real life character (his Howard Hughes makes a neat hat trick with his Oscar winning performances as Dashiell Hammett and Ben Bradley.) Watch for the real-life Melvin Dummar as the counterman in the bus station where Steenburgen makes a sandwich for her daughter. This is a small but knowing and winning movie. It definitely gets my vote for \"Milkman of the Month\"!',\n",

The story line is beyond awful and filled with straight line after straight line. The rest of the original cast is gone- and how many laughs did we get from Max Wrights' dead pan deliveries and exaggerated befuddlement? <br /><br />There were so many alternative stories after the final T.V. episode why Fusco chose the worst possible direction is beyond me (maybe he was hanging with Jerry Stahl at the time of conceiving this project) <br /><br />I say to anyone who in later years discovers the Alf television show to stay away from this movie- it is lame unfunny and a pile of steaminess.

Maybe the director had a different vision to what I am interpreting from what I have seen in it, but this is how it came across to me.

This, being a very early entry to the blaxploitation genre, may have triggered controversy over its showing of racial violence to the general public. It was no doubt that 1970 introduced the phase anyway, with COTTON COMES TO HARLEM. Aside from any historical figures, the authentic detail of dark, inner-city Harlem life was the main attraction along with the bloody, nasty violence. Anthony Quinn\\'s appearance doesn\\'t matter, but Yaphet Kotto\\'s indifferences with him add more juice to the film. \"Blaxplo\" fans have seen stuff like this before, but there are plenty of rough guts to chew on in this action drama where the ghetto is no place to hide or escape from.

In the past, I have been successful avoiding updated versions of classic movies, just to save me from disappointments, but this time I felt like falling in.<br /><br />I was prepared to see much more spectacularity in this 2008 version, the regular special effects, and maybe something new in the script.<br /><br />And yes, there was some new things in the script. A rather inconsistent start, The Cold War is still there, plus the global warning, and maybe the toxic assets. There's also a reference to the altruism enigma.<br /><br />The rest is purely crap.<br /><br />We miss the evangelistic references of the 1952 version. There's no Jude and there's no mortality in Klaatu's enigmatic persona. Instead, he's a rather flat and expressionless superhero, able to control people's mind remotely or bring down helicopters with his hands. No thrill.<br /><br />The rest of the cast ranges from stupid to useless characters. The kid is really hard to stand, and the Secretary Defense is unbelievable. Even the heroin looks little smart despite her academic titles, and there's this pain of watching John Cleese trying to act seriously.<br /><br />But, over all, there you have this gigantic hole in the script. After almost destroying New York (yes, just recovered from the recent havoc of Watchmen!) and lots of stadiums, trucks and the like, Klattu surrenders to rather poor mortal mercy demands, and leaves the planet.<br /><br />Probably then, Klaatu just forgot the movie's name, and sends a command to freeze the whole Earth machinery pool. But... Why does he need to demonstrate his strength with a global warning when he just almost destroyed the planet? Is like sending a newsreel with Los Alamos footage to Hiroshima the 9th of August, 1945. Purely crap. Nonsense crap.<br /><br />Luckily, we still have the 1952 version.\",\n",

The concept of putting together body parts is a contemporary consideration because we are now able to achieve this. The fact that this was written so long ago (by a woman who was challenged by her husband and a friend to see who could write the best horror story) should give it the historic respect it deserves. This film ignores the historic significance and current relevance of Mary Shelly\\'s work.',\n",

              " b'The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a \"Whodunnit?\" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the \"sick sticks\" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.',\n",

The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling.

You could technically call it a \"monster movie\" even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end, and then it\\'s even up to you and your beliefs as to what\\'s happening with the legendary spirit/beast.

              " b'Gloomy Sunday - Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod directed by Rolf Sch\\xc3\\xbcbel in 1999 is a romantic, absorbing, beautiful, and heartbreaking movie. It started like Jules and Jim; it ended as one of Agatha Christie\\'s books, and in between it said something about love, friendship, devotion, jealousy, war, Holocaust, dignity, and betrayal, and it did better than The Black Book which is much more popular. It is not perfect, and it made me, a cynic, wonder in the end on the complexity of the relationships and sensational revelations, and who is who to whom but the movie simply overwhelmed me. Perfect or not, it is unforgettable. All four actors as the parts of the tragic not even a triangle but a rectangle were terrific. I do believe that three men could fell deeply for one girl as beautiful and dignified as Ilona in a star-making performance by young Hungarian actress Erica Marozs\\xc3\\xa1n and who would not? The titular song is haunting, sad, and beautiful, and no doubt deserves the movie been made about it and its effect on the countless listeners. I love the movie and I am surprised that it is so little known in this country. It is a gem.<br /><br />The fact that it is based on a story of the song that had played such important role in the lives of all characters made me do some research, and the real story behind the song of Love and Death seems as fascinating as the fictional one. The song was composed in 1930s by Rezs\\xc3\\xb6 Seress and was believed to have caused many suicides in Hungary and all over Europe as the world was moving toward the most devastating War of the last century. Rezs\\xc3\\xb6 Seress, a Jewish-Hungarian pianist and composer, was thrown to the Concentration Camp but survived, unlike his mother. In January, 1968, Seress committed suicide in Budapest by jumping out of a window. According to his obituary in the New York Times, \"Mr. Seres complained that the success of \"Gloomy Sunday\" actually increased his unhappiness, because he knew he would never be able to write a second hit.\" <br /><br />Many singers from all over the world have recorded their versions of the songs in different languages. Over 70 performers have covered the song since 1935, and some famous names include Billie Holiday, Paul Robeson, Pyotr Leschenko (in Russian, under title \"Mratschnoje Woskresenje\"), Bjork, Sarah McLachlan, and many more. The one that really got to me and made me shiver is by Diamanda Gal\\xc3\\xa1s, the Greek born American singer/pianist/performer with the voice of such tragic power that I still can\\'t get over her singing. Gal\\xc3\\xa1s has been described as \"capable of the most unnerving vocal terror\", and in her work she mostly concentrates on the topics of \"suffering, despair, condemnation, injustice and loss of dignity.\" When she sings the Song of Love and Death, her voice that could\\'ve belonged to the most tragic heroines of Ancient Greece leaves no hope and brings the horror and grief of love lost forever to the unbearable and incomparable heights.<br /><br />8.5/10',\n",

A man bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. What can go wrong? Too much. The movie was not funny. It showed women as catty and men as stupid. There is no reason why he would 'want to keep her' and there is no reason that she 'would fall in love with him.' Granted, they are doing stupid and idiotic things on purpose, but after finding out that they were lying to each other, all is forgiven! And of course the climax is played out in public. Typical Hollywood. In reality, they would be so upset that they lied to each other that they would never see each other again. And any talking would be out of the line of curious ears. But of course, movies are not based on reality.<br /><br />Kate Hudson is very pretty and Matthew McConaughey is quite handsome. The costumes, especially the yellow dress that Hudson wears at the end, are gorgeous. I do think that Hudson as Andie Anderson and McConaughey as Benjamin Barry did well with their talents, but the movie itself stinks. No matter how talented you are, you cannot save a sinking ship.<br /><br />I'm sure several people will like this movie and that is fine, everyone has different tastes. I am a romantic, but I pride myself on being a sensible romantic. Movies of this kind are not romantic to me, just wastes of time. If you want a quality love story, go with something else.

This movie would have been much better if it had a point. It makes brief and ambivalent references to family life, but never really has the guts to develop its critiques.<br /><br />I guess what makes this movie so pathetic is that every character is like all the other characters. What's worse, never in the film, not even at the climax, do any characters distinguish themselves.

              " b\"***WARNING SOME SPOILERS*** The Giant Behemoth was one of the last giant monster-on-the-loose films of the 1950's, a decade that saw all manner of creatures born of the two biggest scientific issues of the decade- space exploration and nuclear weapons. Behemoth fell into the second category, a genre started with the excellent Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, and elaborated upon with Godzilla and Them! However, by the time Behemoth rolled before the cameras, the concept of atomically created monsters had already worn thin. Nevertheless, this is one of the better films of its type; a real gem made on a budget so tiny that it wouldn't even cover the cost of a current feature's end credit listings!<br /><br />Credit for the film's cult reputation must go to the men behind the Behemoth. Although Jack Rabin, Irving Block and Louis DeWitt are first billed in the effects credits, it was King Kong's Willis O'Brien and his assistant Pete Peterson, that brought the Behemoth to life. Their Paleosaurus- though in some ways reminiscent of the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms-is nonetheless a unique creation, with its long neck and legs giving it a stature that makes it tower over most of its surroundings. The skin of the model is finely detailed, with hundreds of minute scales, while the back has a single row of serrated plates, a very realistic model in spite of the movie's low-budget pedigree. The animation, mostly created by Peterson while in a wheelchair due to his advanced multiple sclerosis, is superb; Peterson had learned well from master craftsman O'Brien, and ensured the dinosaur's movements would seem natural, even giving it something of a personality.<br /><br />Despite Peterson and O'Brien's expertise, the film does have some technical flaws (the stiff, live-action prop head that rams the ferryboat is regrettable) but effective stop-motion scenes counterbalance these missteps. In an atmospheric night scene reminiscent of Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, the Behemoth, in silhouette, wanders into some power lines, reacting first with shock, then anger as it attacks the high-tension towers. In the first stop-motion scene of the monster rising from the Thames, the Behemoth strides towards the camera, attacks some dockside cranes, and continues forward, eventually passing over the camera- a trademark of O'Brien's visual style. Sadly, this was also the last film that highlighted his stop-motion work. This makes the movie significant for historians, and a must for buffs.<br /><br />Another aspect of Behemoth that makes it compare favorably to most of its contemporaries at the time was the direction by Eugene Lourie, and the elegant, understated performances. Lourie (who had previously directed Beast From 20,000 Fathoms) attempted to repeat that success with Behemoth, this time not only directing, but screenwriting as well. However, budgetary restrictions forced Lourie to keep the monster off-screen for a longer time. Instead of shots of the monster actually attacking ships and structures (as Ray Harryhausen had done in Beast) Lourie substituted after-the-fact sequences (such as a beached steamship). Not until the creature has actually entered London is the viewer allowed a good look at it. However, it's to Lourie's credit that he eschewed the non-essential romantic subplot typical of most 50's B-movies. As the film was an Anglo-American production, he made the story into an English mystery of sorts, similar to the Dr. Quartermass films. We know from the start that something radioactive is killing fish and men off the coast of England, but it's up to the lead characters to solve the riddle of the source of the radioactivity.<br /><br />In the opening of the film, an American biologist, Steven Karnes (played by Gene Evans) is lecturing a group of scientists about the dangers of not only nuclear weapons testing, but the disposal of radioactive wastes- a warning still timely 45 years later! Evans plays his role straight and understated- he's the hero, yet doesn't let his character exceed what would be expected of a scientist investigating an unusual phenomenon. Likewise, his British counterpart, Prof. Bickford (Andre Morrell) also plays low-key. Evans even allows Karnes to undergo a subtle change in his behavior. In the beginning of the movie, Karnes's blunt, direct (American) attitude puts off the reserved Bickford and other English authorities. Eventually, Karnes begins to adopt a more diplomatic manner, ultimately suggesting rather than demanding that a torpedo be the ideal means of destroying the Behemoth. By treating the film as a detective thriller, Lourie managed to keep it moving, involving the cast in various bits of business that hold the audience even when the animal does not appear. Once the Behemoth surfaces, however, the film exchanges mystery for spectacle, even if on a smaller scale than Beast or Gorgo, Lourie's 3rd (and most spectacular) monster on the loose epic.<br /><br />The only real letdown (other than the prop head) is the demise of the creature. Unlike Beast, with its spectacular finale- as the monster reared up before a burning roller coaster and finally expired- (a nice Harryhausen touch) the Behemoth is simply struck and blown up by the torpedo. Instead of a stop-motion shot of the monster dead or mortally wounded, the unrealistic prop head briefly rises for a final time before plunging into the depths of an obvious studio tank. O'Brien and Peterson probably didn't have time to film the creature's destruction in a more dramatic fashion, although they were certainly capable of wringing pathos out of their creations. The musical score, by Edwin Ashley, while not as bold as David Buttloph's for Beast, still provides both low key tension during non-monster sequences and dramatic enhancement during the monster's rampage. Ashley's work here was likely influenced by passages from Stravinsky's Rite of Spring; it has a primitive, visceral power. Those who like their dinosaur thrills high tech (CGI) may find Behemoth dated, but for those who admire old-fashioned craftsmanship, and for fans of this unique genre, I recommend taking a look at this minor classic.\",\n",

              " b'Bizarre Tobe Hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man(Brad Dourif)with the ability to set people on fire. This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50\\'s. They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend, Lisa(Cynthia Bain)gives him to take for rough migraines. In actuality, Lisa was told to manipulate Sam into taking the pills by Lew Orlander(William Prince), pretty much the young man\\'s father who raised him from a child. Lew has benevolent plans..he sees Sam as the first \"Atomic Man\", a pure killing machine in human form. Sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition. As the film goes, Sam\\'s blood is slowly growing toxic, green in color instead of red. It seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when Sam\\'s uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite. Come to find out, Lisa has Sam\\'s condition whose parents also dies from SHC. Dr. Marsh(Jon Cypher), someone who Sam has known for quite some time as his physician, is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies, I\\'m guessing to increase their levels of flame. Nina(Melinda Dillon, sporting an accent that fades in and out)was Sam\\'s parents\\' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50\\'s who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening. And, Rachel(Dey Young)is Sam\\'s ex-wife who may be working against her former husband with Lew and Marsh to harm him and Lisa.<br /><br />Quite a strange little horror flick, filled with some pretty awful flame-effects. Dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices. There\\'s this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time. Best scene is probably when director John Landis, who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform Sam to hang up because the radio program he\\'s calling has sounded off for the night, becomes a victim of SHC. The flick never quite works because it\\'s so wildly uneven with an abrupt, ridiculous finale where Sam offers to free Lisa of her fire by taking it from her.',\n",
              " b'Well, maybe the PC version of this game was impressive. Maybe. I just finished playing the PS2 version and it\\'s pretty much a complete mess.<br /><br />There are a couple elements that are okay or promising. I\\'ll mention those first because it will be over quickly. First, the idea of a historical GTA-like game is a great one. The game Gun was a historical GTA-like game and unlike Mafia, Gun was excellent. I\\'d love to see a game set during Mafia\\'s era done right. Next, the storyline is well written. The story makes sense, it has dramatic arcs, it uses an unusual device (with much of the game being a backstory) and it\\'s interesting. Finally, some of the graphics--especially those used during cutscenes--are impressive. Mafia\\'s designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where GTA skimped on that effort, especially the characters. Unfortunately in many other areas, the graphics kinda stink, and I\\'d much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive-looking characters.<br /><br />The gameplay is what sinks this title so low. First off, the controls and camera absolutely suck. That has to be the first focus of any game developers. You can\\'t release a game where the controls and/or camera suck. Number one, there\\'s no reason that the player\\'s character, Tom, can\\'t have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick. Unless it\\'s absolutely necessary, and it hardly ever is, I hate the set-up where the left stick moves the character in a \"strafing\" way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick. Here, it\\'s not only unnecessary, it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge. For example, Tom has to climb on a couple missions. But the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera, and then press L1 every time you need to climb, or Tom will descend instead.<br /><br />Next, I\\'ve never seen a worse fighting system. The first problem is that you can\\'t auto-aim or lock on to any targets. At one early point, the game seems to tell you that you can use L2 or R2 to lock on to targets, but that never worked. So to focus on any enemy, you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character\\'s orientation and the camera, which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make Tom disappear all the time. By that time, you\\'re probably getting pummeled or shot to death.<br /><br />Next, if you\\'re touching or almost touching an enemy--and that\\'s certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons, the fighting system--which primarily consists of tapping or holding R1, is completely useless. Enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug, but you just can\\'t move unless you back off. So close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick, yelling at the character to move away, which it won\\'t do 50% of the time, then tapping R1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes R1 useless. And if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime, you\\'re also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything. By that time, you\\'re probably getting pummeled or shot again, and your only option will be to try to move the character away again. My fights often consisted of making Tom run circles around an area like a comedy film, hoping that I could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the AI\\'s mercy again. So much for realistic fighting.<br /><br />And the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns. If you\\'re touching someone, half the time the controller just won\\'t allow you to fire off a shot, yet they can still riddle you full of holes. Additionally, there\\'s no auto-aim, and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive, even with the sensitivity set to zero under Options. Gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you. Luckily or not, damage seems to be recorded almost randomly. It can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character, and there\\'s no rhyme or reason to it. You can put five shots into an enemy\\'s head and near point blank range and they\\'ll still return fire and hurt you. Yet, the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system, so after shots with powerful enough guns, your aim will float off target, and you\\'ll have to fight with it again.<br /><br />As for the celebrated graphics, except for the characters and textures that you\\'re close to, they\\'re actually pretty disappointing. The distance always seems mostly empty, and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you\\'re driving. The city wasn\\'t very well designed. It\\'s not varied enough, and there aren\\'t many interesting things to see or do. The cars seem slow and they\\'re difficult to control. They also all drive about the same. Some have mentioned the music, but that was also pretty nondescript. A much better job could have been done on that end. Also, as many others have mentioned, the load times are ridiculous and constant. They tend to be over a minute long, and they occur between and in the middle of everything--even races.<br /><br />Overall, the Mafia port to PS2, at least, seems to have been very rushed. The game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job.',\n",
              " b'Jeff Speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like \"The Expert\", you can see why. There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - are all over the place, there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose, 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total, some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark, 3) The music score is overzealous and overbearing. Strange as it may seem, this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that you\\'re watching some sort of grand epic, instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching. With all that said, at least there\\'s James Brolin around to lend a touch of credibility. *1/2 out of 4.',\n",

Dolph lundgren is a badaass in this and made me remember how much i love him sure he was never as big a star as most of the action hero's of the 80's but as he proves here, he's the one who's ruling the genre now cus he plays one mean mofo here, the story has Dolph's wife and kid murdered by the Russian mafia, he moves to los angelos and seven years later he is asked to go back to Russia to bring back somebody's daughter back, he refuses to do it at first until he realises it is the same gangster that killed his family seven years ago, so he goes to get his bloody revenge, the mechanik is violent and dark but its great entertainment and delivers the goods, sure the story has been done many times before but the way it is made and its style just make the mechanik an action classic, Dolph lundgren also directed it and does a brilliant job crafting one of the best action/thriller's for the past ten years.

              " b'Watching \"Kroko\" I would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life. I would not recommend to watch this movie: flat main characters - absolutely no development e.g. Kroko the metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot-wise chances to do so. Uninspired actors, non-evolving plot. I guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed: camera appeared shaky rather than motivated. Pictures were low - contrast, gray and dark - i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu. The story had certain potential though, it could have made a good short story.',\n",
              " b\"First of all, I have to start this comment by saying I'm a huge Nightmare on Elm Street fan. I think it's the greatest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, which tried to be the last chapter back then, is a weird movie. It doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some think it makes him less scary, which I do agree. And that's, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so we can know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he were, how he became the man haunting our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil. Obviously those people won't like Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. To truly enjoy this one, you have to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you. This was the first one, and it was awesome. As the years passed by, Freddy killed more and more people, and nobody could ever get rid of him for good. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's realm of terror. Beside the story of Freddy's past, I also really liked the atmosphere of the movie. No more kids in Springwood, only crazy grown-ups. The nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the opening song called ''I'm Awake Now'' performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can't believe it's so underrated. Maybe it is misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too, and a lot of cameos! Get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed.\",\n",
              " b\"Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue, bad flashbacks, and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men.<br /><br />O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he, too, is terribly underused.<br /><br />The film has one additional positive aspect, in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many of today's films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil, when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!<br /><br />This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is the movie for you.\",\n",
              " b\"Man... I thought I'd seen some bad movies before, but this is seriously the worst ever. Its so bad, that if you are even the least bit drunk or high you'll find this movie hilarious. There are 6-8 totally ugly chicks who all just keep getting naked. The production value is zero, think high school project done in a weekend. It was obviously filmed in a park, and nothing, no amount of seeing the people in the movie naked could ever make up for how terrible this movie is. Yea I laughed my ass off, but if you have to spend even one dollar on it, its overpriced. I caught it on latenight television, and I felt bad, really bad, for everyone involved in the movie. You can't plan on making something this bad, it has to just happen. A quick spoiler: the hobbits, or whatever they're called in this movie, enter a tavern which is supposed to be in the forrest in medieval time and make out on the tavern pool table, which looks brand new.

              " b\"SPOILERS<br /><br />Yes, yes, I know this is not a Holiday show, let alone movie, but I really wanted to comment on it. This show is created by who else than Matt Groening, who obviously created the Simpsons. Although it may not be as good as the Simpsons it is still a fantastic comedic cartoon. The characters in Futurama also have overbites like the characters in the Simpsons. The characters are not yellow, though. As you know by now, Futurama takes place in the future, so there are robots, aliens, one-eyed aliens that look like regular humans, people from Mars that look like regular people, one hundred sixty year old men, and much, much more. The future contains tubes that suck people to places, booths that can kill you, and hover cars. <br /><br />A pizza delivery boy named Fry who goes out to deliver pizza. It is almost the year 2000. At the place where he is supposed to deliver the pizza he falls into a freezer. He is frozen. One thousand years go by. It is the year 3000. When he thaws out he is flabbergasted at what he sees. He learns that his nephew Professor Farnsworth lives close by. He meets a robot named Bender. All he does is drink and smoke cigars. He meets Leela, a one-eyed alien that looks like a regular human. She chases him to make him get his delivery job. He finds Farnsworth. Bender, Leela, and Fry become delivery people, alien, and robot. Fry also meets Amy, Hermes, and Dr. Zoidberg. All of them go on zany adventures.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic cartoon. Although it may not be as good, it's still great. I never found this show to be as funny as the Simpsons, though. I mean, there's laugh-out-loud moments, but just no as much as the Simpsons had. I also found some endings to Futurama are incredibly sad and depressing. Some of the endings include the ending to Jurassic Bark, when a flashback shows that Fry's dog in the past had waited next to the pizza parlour for Fry to return for the rest of his life. I mean, it's so sad, the dog had waited for him. The dog's eyes were so sad and hopeful. Also the end in Time Keeps on Slipping was really depressing. Anyway, this is a great show.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Recommended Titles: The Simpsons.\",\n",
              " b'\"Die Hard\" is the prototype type for the modern action film. Since it\\'s also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing. \"Die Hard\" is lean, mean, and doesn\\'t contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since \"Die Hard\" was first released in 1988, it\\'s difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn\\'t follow the basic structure and format of \"Die Hard\" . . . or, for that matter, is better than \"Die Hard\".<br /><br />\"Die Hard\" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures. Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it\\'s up to John McClane to save the day . . . .<br /><br />Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim. The story isn\\'t completely believable, but it\\'s believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over. There\\'s also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what\\'s going to happen next . . . and the surprises don\\'t come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out. (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, \"Die Hard\" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written. McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action. A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, \"Die Hard\" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that\\'s why it stands out so clearly from them all. With \"Die Hard\", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.<br /><br />As for the acting, it\\'s darn near close to perfect. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. As played by Willis, McClane\\'s a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane\\'s also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. There\\'s more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism. The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it\\'s darn brilliant. (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.) There\\'s only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman\\'s performance as the villain Hans Gruber. The Machiavellian Gruber would\\'ve been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn\\'t travel the easy route. Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero. He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it\\'s hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand. Other actors probably could\\'ve played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains. As for the rest of the cast, they\\'re all pretty good. Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John\\'s soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual \"damsel in distress\" mold. It\\'s also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero. The character is stupid to a fault, and he\\'s wonderful because of it.<br /><br />\"Die Hard\" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly. There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is \"Die Hard\" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it\\'s undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film. Grade: A',\n",

Benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. Unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects Rukh\\'s brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.<br /><br />While Rukh is continuing his work, Sir Frances takes news of the discovery back to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. When he returns to France he learns of the healing power of Radium X as he cures his mother\\'s (Violet Kemble Cooper) blindness and of Benet\\'s work in curing the maladies of his patients.<br /><br />But Rukh\\'s madness intensifies.

This angers Rukh and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition. One night he is lured into a trap set by Benet and...........<br /><br />Karloff is excellent in the lead role moving from a happily married ambitious scientist to a raving maniac.

              " b\"This movie has no redeeming qualities (okay a couple of inventive deaths but you'll be bored getting to them). Writing a review of it seems to be a waste of time but I've already wasted 90 minutes of my life watching it so if I can stop other people from doing the same then it was worth it. Think for a minute what makes bad horror movies so bad and you have Night of the Scarecrow. The director needs to go back to film school and study suspense again because this movie doesn't have any. Let me say this one last time: gore does not equal horror!!! The gore in the movie is even quite lame. I find Scarecrows scary so I had high hopes for this film but it's just another example of why horror movies get such a bad rap. The acting is mediocre as are the few shocks that the film has. Do yourself a favour and skip this dud. 1 out of 10.\",\n",
              " b\"I hated it. The movie made wandered away from the book so much, it was almost painful to see it. <br /><br />First of all Dr. Mortimer was a young man and his age was the key in the opening sequence of the novel. By making him an old large man destroyed the very beginning of the story. <br /><br />Then, the main characters - In one scene Holmes is using violence to get his way, which he NEVER did unless the situation was life-threatening. If we was beating people up to get answers then he would be a pretty dumb detective. Besides that, this Holmes is arrogant and a big snob. I am not so fond of the original character, but he was better than this. And Watson is so undeveloped. He is like a enclosure to Holmes, just sitting there and doing nothing, while Holmes is babbling on and on (he never babbled, he was a man of silent action). <br /><br />And the plot was changes so much, I don't know where to start pointing out the wrongs. I will only say, that Barrymore was flashing the lights for the runaway murderer who just happened to be his wife's brother. Why did he do it - the spouses were feeding him, while his was hiding before moving to South America (he never had the chance).\",\n",

Maybe Bartok should have made that story instead: clueless wannabe screenwriter desecrates legacy of legendary British director of \"Tales From the Crypt,\" causing famed director to rise from dead and turn idiot writer-producer into Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />So why did Bartok do it? Maybe he thought by rounding up a few veteran directors, his picture was in the bag -- no matter how awful the writing was.

              " b\"NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA has almost everything to be a successful epic: distinguished cast, impressive sets, good production values; the only thing missing is a real epic feeling. In emphasizing the personal story of the imperial couple, the director neglected the epic grandeur of the tale and period to the point that the result resembles a claustrophobic stage play full of talking heads rather than a real movie that shows EVERYTHING that happens in the story=thousands of soldiers, thousands of civilians, the endless landscapes of Russia, etc. This is a Shakespearean tragedy that demands GRANDEUR, but is instead filmed as if it were one of those bourgeois plays by Chekhov about silly provincial families wasting their time and lives in silly provincial towns. There are so many opportunities for GRANDEUR: the astounding Battle of Tsu Shima--one of the grandest battles in naval history--which ended the Russo-Japanese War; the huge battles of the Great War--Tannenberg, the Brusilov Offensive--; the civil war between the Reds and the Whites=all these would have made dynamic and exciting cinema! Apparently the budget for the movie was exhausted in hiring the all-star supporting cast, for the epic events of Nicholas' reign are merely suggested by symbolic gestures: a few soldiers marching here, a few civilians demonstrating there, photographs of Wilhelm II and Franz Joseph I to represent the enemy at World War I, etc. Franklin Schaffner evidently thought that he was directing a stage production, where representing mighty battles and broad vistas was impossible. How could that happen?! The director of such perfectly exciting movies as THE WAR LORD, PLANET OF THE APES (1968) and PATTON should have known better! All in all, a sadly wasted opportunity; what could have been a brilliant epic worthy of David Lean turned instead into a solid but stolid plod.\",\n",

In one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband. <br /><br />Lest you think this is typical German brutishness we in America today have Lady Bush imperiously ordering the arrest of Gold Star Mothers (mothers of US service-members killed in action) because their very presence is offencive.

Years later Ruth's daughter Hannah sets out in search of her mother's past and meets 90 year old Lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war.<br /><br />I did deem it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the Ostfront.\",\n",
              " b'Nell Shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the Maxwell automobile\\'s off-road capabilities. The plot of the movie is pretty simple, Nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writer\\'s block, and needs inspiration, so she goes to visit Mexico to absorb the atmosphere. There she meets the hero (Bert Van Tuyle), a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse. While Nell is visiting with her father\\'s partner at his mining camp, a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness. The hero needs to get to her quickly, so he decides to drive there in his car. This is where the film takes a weird twist. Bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable, huge rocks, small streams, heavy brush, scraggly tree stumps, steep inclines, etc etc, for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles. Now mind you, this isn\\'t a modern-day ATV, it\\'s a 1920 Maxwell automobile, so it looks very out-of-place as an off-road vehicle. And it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters, we get to see it stuck more than once in this film. But the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles. Once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl, he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit (on horseback), and at this point it became hysterically funny to me. Watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks, getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush, going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs, the bandits should have had ample time to catch up. But they never do, even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night. And in a silly climax, the car climbs a mountainside, and helps Nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits.<br /><br />After seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 Maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off-road capabilities than Hummers and Bradley tanks combined. Watch this film just for laughs, it\\'s worth it just to see Nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying \"You did your best, brave little car\"',\n",

Unless you\\'re a real art-house devotee, you probably don\\'t catch many documentaries. Only a handful get any recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years.<br /><br />Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year a group of inmates present a Shakespearean play. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the troupe as roles are self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed and ultimately performed.<br /><br />The movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us that have not been exposed to prison environments. Despite the labels we know them by (convict, felon, murderer, etc.) we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking feeling human beings. Serendipitously, the play chosen for the year of filming was The Tempest, with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption. The actors all grapple with the relevance of the play to their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama.<br /><br />For a documentary film, like a book, the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation for me. \"O brave new world, that has such creatures in it.\"',\n",
              " b'It\\'s very easy to criticise a film like \"for the boys\", after all it is sentimental and there is singing, a sure fire vote killer. Despite this I liked it, in fact I more than liked it. Why because it has a heart it may be sentimental sometimes but it works, the singing works, and there isn\\'t that much of it.<br /><br />The reason this film really works is Bette Midler that age old phrase a tour de force is the only thing that you can say, the woman is fantastic. Sassy, vulnerable, moving. She brings to the part a great depth and an impressive range of emotions, most of which are underplayed, making them all the more powerful for it. Well deserving of her Oscar nomination and a little robbed not being chosen as the winner. James Cann is also very good and the production values are high well written and all in all much better than you might think.<br /><br />Yes there are some dodgy bits like the old age make up, though the makeup in the sixties was better, the ending is weak and it was a pity to go out with a whimper considering the rest of the film had such balls. These though are not enough to spoil the film.',\n",

Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile.\",\n",

              " b'The first thing I always tell myself before I watch a low-budget Sci-Fi film is: \"be prepared: it\\'s bound to be bad to at least some noticeable degree.\" Occasionally, there\\'s a film that passes by that is decent enough to be watchable and those films get my praise for their results on such a low budget. However, very few of them get to that level. Most of them are what they are: bad films. And \"King of the Lost World\" is about as bad as they get.<br /><br />The film is said to be based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s novel \"The Lost World\". I personally have never read it, but based on the previous film adaptations of the story, I can assume that it is nothing like the novel. Pretty much there are only two possible similarities that I see from them. One: a lost world with monsters. Two: the names of some of the characters. Speaking of the characters, they are about as bland and irritating as ever. They are just what I expected, or worse. There\\'s the tough guy wanting to be a leader, his assistant who will take over some point during the film, girls who are just there to scream and be love interests for our leading characters, and characters that are just simply annoying to the other characters and even more so annoying to the audience. The new plot is very dull and it just takes odd twists and turns and adds unnecessary and extremely underdeveloped subplots that lead up to keys in the climax. A climax which we don\\'t really care about.<br /><br />Special effects on the film are even worse that I expected. The CGI graphics used in \"King of the Lost World\" are absolutely horrendous. We see giant insects and other creatures that look so incredibly cheap, they aren\\'t even laughable. And the way they are incorporated in with the sound effects and the action is inexcusable. I remember this one sequence where Bruce Boxleitner\\'s character shoots his gun at a giant scorpion or something like that. We hear a gunshot that is so quiet it\\'s like a dull thump, and then the scorpion just simply whips away from sight, so quickly it almost just disappears. Other graphics are so horrible they seem to be blurry. That mostly revolves around the so-called \"King\" of this Lost World, who I assume is the giant gorilla whom we see next to nothing of for a long time. Good thing, too. Because the graphics used on the giant ape made it almost difficult to see what it was. And that\\'s not all that was blurry. Scenes of our bland human characters and oftentimes in scenes so dark that the camera doesn\\'t even focus very well. It\\'s almost as if somebody filmed it in their back yard using a cheap camcorder.<br /><br />Is there anything positive about \"King of the Lost World\"? Yes. A few things. It had good set designs and a fairly good music score. But that\\'s just about it. Overall, it was just a very bland and mind-numbingly boring excuse for an adventure story. And it\\'s not a patch on the original 1925 version of \"The Lost World\" or the so-so 1960 version.<br /><br />Bottom line: don\\'t bother with it. You can find better even on a long, dark rainy day.',\n",
              " b\"Predator is the classic action film. What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved. The genius of that! The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end. He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see. Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy. The whole cast worked very well together. <br /><br />The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator. The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius. I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame. I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit. I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) <br /><br />Predator is evidence of how action films should be done. A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along. A timeless classic, one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />**** out of **** stars<br /><br />P.S. The 'forest massacre' scene is one of the funniest scenes in movie history!!\",\n",

Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again. I'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love, family and friendship.<br /><br />It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing. And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006.<br /><br />This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the entire family.<br /><br />I bought this movie on DVD and have watched it with friends many times. Because it portrays the values that are important in life.\",\n",
              " b\"Very entertaining and affecting story of women's struggle for the vote. Rather than the period-piece drama one would get on a BBC show about the movement, this portrays very modern, very impassioned women. The director is determined to avoid any hint of stuffiness, and at times the gimmicky camera work seems there not to further the story but just to make sure this works for the MTV generation, but the result is a dynamic and entertaining movie. I've never heard much of anything about the women's suffrage movement and it is interesting to see how it played out and to learn a little about the movie's impassioned heroine Alice Paul and her struggle both with the patriarchy and with the more cautious suffragettes. She seems to have been a fascinating woman, and judging from her photographs, almost as cute as Hillary Swank.\",\n",
              " b'This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between Jeff Webster(Jimmy Stewart) and Ronda Castle(Ruth Roman). She takes an instant liking to Jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder. They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them. Gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from Skagway to Dawson. But Ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff Gannon and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in Skagway. She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff. Meanwhile, Rene, a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return. Yet, she sticks with him in his travels from Skagway to Dawson and his activities around Dawson. Along with Ronda, she nurses him back to health after Jeff is left for dead by Gannon\\'s gunslingers at his gold claim. Walter Brennan, as Ben, serves as Jeff\\'s long time sidekick. He doesn\\'t have a meaty role, but serves to soften Jeff\\'s hard edges. His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for Jeff.<br /><br />John McIntire(as Sheriff Gannon) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. Evidently, he sees something of himself in Jeff, repeatedly declaring that he\\'s going to like him. He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous Soapy Smith, who spent his last years in Skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times.<br /><br />Jeff is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion Ben), who doesn\\'t want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. In this respect, he closely resemble\\'s Burt Lancaster\\'s character in \"Vera Cruz\", for example. Thus, Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson, he is convinced to leave Dawson after Gannon\\'s gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone\\'s insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from Dawson. Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff make a hurried exit from Dawson while they are still alive. Then, Jeff has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of Ben and himself. He changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of Gannon\\'s gang from Dawson. In this respect, he differs from Lancaster\\'s character, who never reforms(But is Jeff truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)<br /><br />The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women. Clearly, Ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame Jeff. Although she is clearly characterized as a \"bad\" girl, Jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon. Ironically, soon after Jeff changes from anti-hero to hero, Rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn Jeff of Gannon\\'s impending ambush. She dies as a result and Jeff asks her why she didn\\'t just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).<br /><br />It\\'s clear that Corine Calvert, as Renee, just doesn\\'t make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda, in Jeff\\'s mind. Yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though Jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug. Her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in Rhonda\\'s saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later. I\\'m also very unclear about her relationship with Rube Morris, a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.(He\\'s not her father).<br /><br />Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between Jeff and Gannon\\'s gang. If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk, before Jeff did the same to him. And how did Jeff\\'s badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims. They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow. And why weren\\'t most of Ronda\\'s pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?<br /><br />You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and Gannon\\'s gang. The sequences shot in the Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. All-in-all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end. No doubt, this film takes some great liberties with history and geography, especially, the part taking place in the Canadian Yukon, which was in fact much tamer than the US Skagway.',\n",
              " b\"I honestly wasn't expecting Bambi 2 to be as good as it was. I found it it sweet, funny and adorable. The original Bambi is not only one of my favourite Disney movies, but one of my favourite movies ever. I thought this a very worthy sequel, well it was more of a midquel really, if a tad rushed in places. I liked the fact that they focused on Bambi and his father, after his mother dies, and the story itself was very sweet and well crafted. The animation was beautiful here, not quite as splendid as its predecessor. I have seen sequels like FernGully 2 and Secret of NIMH 2 where the animation is dull, tacky and choppy. Here it was colourful, vibrant and fluid, just look at the wondrous backgrounds. And I absolutely loved the soundtrack, that alone contributed to the film's charm. Of course I do slightly prefer the original's music, but the soundtrack here was so pleasant to the ears. The characters were every bit as likable as they were in the first- Bambi if you forgive the fact his facial expressions were overdone at times, was still adorable and appealing, and Thumper is hilarious. If there is one thing I prefer over the original, it is that the sequel is funnier than the original. The original, while having some very funny moments was more of a tearjerker and a genuine one it was too. In the sequel, there are five or six funny bits in the first fifteen minutes alone. The voice acting was most impressive, special mention must go to Patrick Stewart, who was perfect as the Great Prince. My final verdict is that it isn't quite as good as the stunning original, but along with King Of Thieves and Enchanted Christmas, this is in the top 5 of my favourite sequels. A solid 8/10 Bethany Cox\",\n",

And much more than that: war of White and Red Roses, Gollum for a sheriff, chest, full of gold, old lady - gunfighter (who happened to be also animated eight-handed woman and Quentin Tarantino\\'s lover), Tarantino himself, rather weather-beaten and riding steampunk-crafted wheelchair, raining bullets, Japanese mountains in the autumn, fight in the snow and so on. Just imagine \"Kill Bill\" cut to 2 hours, without all the dull stuff but with all the goods delivered straight to the point. Everything funny, hysterical, strange and enchanting you can squeeze out of old good Westerns plus amazing Japanese aesthetics (watch the leader of Whites.

But he really annoys me. Anyway, I watched the show (taking a break from English coursework) and was pleasantly surprised.

The movie shows how marriages progress thru time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogs are quite good. The movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization. Also shows perfect is after all not so perfect. Shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The movie is very well written and directed.',\n",

However, I understand now, it was something this poor child could give love to. I also remember how devastating it was to see the poor creature lose it's life by getting hit by a car. It should be required viewing for youth today who seem to have no respect for animal life. I'm wondering whether or not they would even understand the message.

The zombies here are a little bit faster though.<br /><br />It begins with a nice back story and then builds slowly in pace to a climactic frenzy. The effects are top notch, solid directing, a really imaginative and eerie production design and great acting.<br /><br />Yes, i may be a little biased but i really like Milla Jovovich. I think this is the kind of role that fits her best, strong kick ass attitude with an odd personality wrapped in a seemingly fragile shell. Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in \"The fifth element\" and also the character in the later \"Ultraviolet\" The other actors did a good job as well so she\\'s not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character. The child AI is a very nice and creepy addition to the atmosphere.<br /><br />The RE theme could have ended up as a nice trilogy but the sequel unfortunately lacks nearly everything(except Milla) that this film delivers. Not that RE2 is a complete mess but nowhere near this.

The Gregory Peck character lost his bride during the German bombing of London, needs to find a purpose for living. He'll soon find it, as there's much need for able men not only in the hero department but also pretty girls need attention -- even in the Burma jungle.<br /><br />The themes of duty, courage, purpose, tenacity and redemption ride deep, and there's enough patriotism and faith to make any godless liberals in the audience cringe like Dracula facing a Crucifix. The Burma locations add a lot, as do the high production standards. They knew how to make good movies 50 years ago -- unlike today.<br /><br />This film has real heroes. Today's cocaine-soaked film industry only knows about comic book-style Super Heroes, who fight make-believe enemies using only the weapon of computer animation. They offer nothing to the younger generation save for inspiration fire up the PlayStation. Moral bankruptcy for the Bevis and Butthead audience; grown-ups (12 and older) are the forgotten audience.<br /><br />Gregory Peck made lots of excellent films prior to his dreadful (but Oscar winning) role of Aticus Finch. The Purple Plain is a fine example of his acting and star quality. Sadly, Peck just went to the dogs the last years of his career.<br /><br />Not only were movies better in 1954, but watching them was better. I saw The Purple Plain at Loew's Capitol Theatre -- the most deluxe theater that ever existed in Washington, DC. With its giant screen (largest ever), stereo sound and 3645 seats, you could sit in an atmosphere that would make the Emperor of China green with envy.\",\n",
              " b\"The Purple Plain is a winner, a handsomely mounted WW2 drama set in Burma where the Japanese are never seen: the enemy is the hostile landscape and the memories that cripple its hero. Gregory Peck's damaged pilot is still suffering from a bad case of 12 O'Clock High after the death of his wife in an air raid on their wedding night until he falls for Burmese girl Win Min Tan. (This being 1954, they may share an inter-racial romance, but they never actually kiss.) Naturally, as soon as he rediscovers a reason for living he's shot down behind enemy lines and has to make it back with not one but two crippled comrades. It's not much of a plot, true, but it's handled extremely well thanks to Robert Parrish's direction, which is surprisingly strong, direct and imaginative when called for, but still knows when to be unobtrusive as well. Great last shot too.\",\n",

              " b'While the gameplay of Jedi Knight II is far superior to Jedi Knight, I think the game is a bit of a dissapointment in other areas. For one thing, I much prefer the live action cutscenes in JK1 to the ones rendered with the game engine in JK2. The live action cutscenes really brought the story to life in JK1. Since the acting in JK2 is done by Quake 3 models, the cutscenes lack any sign of life. They look especially lifeless and flat where there are supposed to be emotional scenes, such as Jan and Kyle kissing.<br /><br />I have played JK1 many times and I always watch the cutscenes fully. I even go back sometimes just to watch the cutscenes because they are done so well. When I play JK2 again, I\\'ll probably just skip the cutscenes because I think they look very amateurish. It\\'s almost as if the cutscenes are an afterthought to join the levels together, not as a part of the overall story as in Jedi Knight.<br /><br />*Spoilers below*<br /><br />Now we come to the story. While JK2\\'s story is ok, it is no where near as good as JK1. In the beginning of the game we find out that Kyle has given up his force abilities. He and Jan now operate as mercenaries for the New Republic. After several levels fighting imperials, it appears as if Jan is killed by a Dark Jedi called Desann. Kyle then goes to Luke Skywalker to get his lightsaber and force abilities back so he can avenge Jan\\'s death.<br /><br />Now here is the really odd part about this story. It doesn\\'t seem to bother Luke that Kyle wants to regain his force powers so he can get revenge. If I understand Star Wars correctly, revenge along with fear, hate, agression, etc... will lead to the Dark side! Don\\'t you think Luke would try to object to this a bit more? The rest of it is pretty average \"kill the bad guy and get the girl\" type stuff.<br /><br />*Spoilers end*<br /><br />Overall, Raven have done an excellent job with the gameplay and level design, but the story is pretty average and I REALLY WANT PROPER CUTSCENES!!!<br /><br />I gave it 8/10 though because the game is a lot of fun to play and the multiplayer is excellent.

If I can save someone from watching it, I will have done a good thing.<br /><br />This \"new\" version is loaded with talent, and it all goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OKs an ugly, sterile, one note set. He proceeds to film the movie from every arty, distracting, self-centered angle possible. We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close ups of eyes, chins, and on and on. The screenplay, by a Nobel Laureate, introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter, that is being faked by both parties,.... I think?? Given the character \"twists\" how would I know? The characters themselves,so richly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. The running time has been cut by an hour, which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the Director did for us. The actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. Jude Law is over the top more than Caine, but as the credited Producer, must have had Branagh\\'s blessing.<br /><br />All in all I found this to be an ugly to look at, unconvincing shell of a former classic. Why was it even made??? The paying public spent less that $4M worldwide to see it! A vanity piece of work that fails at every turn.',\n",

Whatever the reason, when you name your leading character \"Meaney\", portray virtually all the characters in a realistic style and then have the main character turn into a tree, then you\\'ve got a melange that sinks under the woven strands of too many stylistic ideas. <br /><br />I would also like to comment on the cinematographer\\'s lighting (though ultimately the director has to o.k. the look when he sees the dailies.) Disclaimer: I worked as a lighting technician in the mainstream U.S. film industry for 25 years. Most of the time when movies are transferred from film/digital to DVD, the bottom line is to do it as cheaply as one can. One really can\\'t fairly comment on good lighting or bad lighting because of this (this cheap approach also heavily impacts sound transfer). But in this film the aesthetic behind many of the interior scenes was that of a hack; let\\'s bash the light in and shoot it. There\\'s way too much \"flat\" lighting. That is, no contrast in the light on faces or objects EVEN THOUGH THE LIGHT SOURCES LEND THEMSELVES TO GREAT POTENTIAL LIGHTING; lighting that could help further the story.<br /><br />Good performances don\\'t make it when they are serving a poor story in a technically flawed movie.',\n",
              " b\"This film reminded me of going to the zoo. Here you have a community of individuals that are captured by the thought of a longer life, freedom, and food, only when they arrive (like animals in zoo); they are shocked by the realism that it is not a vacation. Food will be served at your captor's convenience, your captors determine the chain of command as well, and finally, nobody can leave once they arrive. After WWII, under Stalin's regime, Russia invites all defectors back to their homeland, but it is a trick. Est-Ouest tells the story of one family's plight to escape a country that has transformed into a wall-less prison. With the KGB watching their every move, our heroes must risk everything to see the light of freedom once more. Living in a post 9/11 world, one cannot help but begin to see the similarities between what Alexei and Marie and the Arab world in America. While not quite as harsh, we constantly are reminded about the vengeful eye of our government and the illustrious Patriot Act.<br /><br />Est-Ouest is one of those films where you could either be excited and happy by the results or be bursting into an emotional sea of tears. From the opening credit sequence until the darkened words crept back on the screen, this film captivated me. With the powerful acting, the intense story, and the brilliant work behind the camera, Est-Ouest will pull hard on your emotions and not release you until the very end. Director R\\xc3\\xa9gis Wargnier has done a superb job of bringing the history of the characters, as well as the land, straight into your hearts. He does this with some of the most common techniques and a very simple story. This is a story about love and freedom. He uses these simplistic structures to keep us focused on the overall depth and tone of the film. There is this feeling of being in a non-barred cage, unable to escape, unable to be free due to the vengeful eye of your comrades. Wargnier forces you to feel for these characters, from the beginning until the end, because they are no different than you are I. They are placed in a situation like no other, yet somehow so real that we could witness it happen even today.<br /><br />From our initial meeting with Alexei and Marie on the boat heading to Russia, we are bombarded with a sense of pride, love, and fear all at once. We are unfamiliar with the relationship between Alexei and Marie, but immediately take it as a loving one. Perhaps we are too haste with that decision, because as our story unfolds, as does the bond that connects these two individuals \\xc2\\x85 or at least that is what Wargnier would like us to think. Est-Ouest is more than just a story about escaping to freedom, it is a contrast between patience and immediate self-sacrifice. Marie wants to escape the cold world they inhabit immediately, she wants to see Paris again and taste its freedom, while Alexei does as well, just not quite as quickly. He understands the rules of the nation, and slowly sets in motion a plan that will give his wife all that he has promised. It took me until the end of the film to see this contrast between immediate escape and patience. While I thought that it was a great message to show, I felt as if the timing was a bit off throughout the film. I had trouble following the timeline, while I did realize that several years had passed between these horrific events, the only person that seemed to age was Alexei's son. I needed a stronger connection between these riveting scenes so that I could keep track in my mind the time that had passed.<br /><br />The acting was gorgeous. Oleg Menshikov and Sandrine Bonnaire had such a powerful connection on screen that I could not keep my eyes off them. When they were together you wanted them to be, and when they were apart, you dreamt of them being back together. You cannot say that of many film characters. The late Sergei Bodrov Jr. reminded me of a Russian Brad Pitt. The way he carried himself and acted in this film was similar to that of Mr. Pitt. Together these three key players brought this film to life. While somehow Catherine Deneuve received top billing as well, she didn't seem to carry as much of the weight that I had hoped that she would. While she was vital to the story, I felt she could have brought more to her character. The depth behind her words just wasn't there or just didn't seem to match the emotion of everyone else.<br /><br />The only other negative aspect that I have with this film was that I felt the story seemed incomplete. There were moments where we were given a nibble to enjoy, but never fully developed those nibbles into bites. There were elements of the story that needed to be developed further, such as the relationship between Sasha and Marie. While I did see some evolution when they were in Russia, it was later that I needed the follow-up. It just felt as if some strings were not tied at the end, but instead left frayed with questions looming in the air.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a very tight drama. There were some flaws with may have caused it to loose its Oscar win in 1999, but nonetheless, the good did outweigh the bad. The characters were intense, the story (outside of the loose ends) was captivating, and being able to see a darker side of the world was thrilling. Simply put, this was a story about freedom and love, and those are themes that transcend throughout history. Est-Ouest is a story for seeing the destructive nature of Stalinism and its impact on humanity.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****\",\n",

Matthew Broderick as the man character Nick Stutapolis or what ever the heck his name is, is perhaps the worst acting I have ever seen on film.

It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect were horrible, I hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?<br /><br />Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me, it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder. There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least.<br /><br />What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are awful. The chief of army staff looks unconvincing. To make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours.\",\n",

In their pursuit of this innocent woman, they wine and dine her, and ultimately humiliate her in such a way that can only be describes as inhuman.

One of the boys is seduced by the slut wife of the local sheriff, while the group is chased by two bad elements from their school. Once in the lake, one by one is killed by a murderer, and the survivors guess who might be the criminal.<br /><br />\"Adam & Evil\" is the perfect cheesy movie: the silly and flawed screenplay seems to be written by a moron, so stupid it is with laughable dialogs and situations; the shameful direction is inexistent; the unknown ham actors and actresses show a total lack of talent at least in this movie. The story has lots of holes and clich\\xc3\\xa9s, and it is funny to see, for example, the car fully loaded with eight persons, and I guess where all of the camping stuff was transported. When the group finds that there are three dead friends, they split to facilitate the work of the killer. The twist disclosing the criminal is one of the most terrible and ridiculous that I have ever seen.

Their quest is also interesting, as they keep finding more and more planes that crashed on the island, which sets up a nice mystery, and then they\\'re captured by the tribe of natives and we\\'re pretty much in the B-movie fun zone after that.<br /><br />Overall, a surprisingly watchable low-budget effort.

That I feel is the greatest contribution of this clearly pathetic movie. I\\'ll admit, I think I rented it when it came out on video, although I was very young so I will assume my mom rented it for me. Anyway, I remember little form the movie, maybe a part where some people get electrocuted during a photo, a potential fox hunt gone sour and a scene with a leader of an African country.

              " b'It is true that Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy were far more effective in their national audience on radio than in the movies. This was due to the close-up affect of cinematography on Bergen\\'s face - he could not hide the fact that his lips moved a little. When on a stage in a nightclub or in vaudeville he\\'d be too far away to be seen moving his lips. Not so on film. <br /><br />But Bergan and McCarthy put ventriloquism on the map. Their act and radio show took the art of throwing one\\'s voice and brought a biting humor to it, giving the dummy a real personality: a wise guy little man, with an eye for the ladies and an eye for making trouble for people he did not like (among whom was Fields). The feud of McCarthy and Fields mirrored the contemporary feud of Fred Allan and Jack Benny, except that Allan and Benny were both real. But on radio Charlie was as real as \"Uncle Claude\" was, so the fact that it was a block of wood that was manipulated fighting a real life man did not matter. The public just loved Charlie reminding Fields of his alcoholism, in particular his large red nose. And the public loved the threats of Fields to give Charlie a ride on a buzz saw.<br /><br />Because of the strong personality of McCarthy, a movie audience even today looks at this film and tends to ignore Bergen\\'s slight lip movements. Charlie is the real personality of interest, not Edgar - here playing a hard working young man who would like to marry Vicki Whipsnade (Constance Moore) but is resigned that she wants to marry a wealthy young wastrel instead. Bergen could act (look at his performance in I REMEMBER MAMA, as Ellen Corby\\'s boyfriend/husband, and his comic scene there with Oskar Homolka regarding the dowry). But he did not have to act as Bergen here - all he had to do was let Charlie do his job (and, for that matter, let Mortimer Snerd do his work too in two scenes). The tricks used by the director to have scenes where Charlie appears without Bergan are just even more effective, as they enhance the idea of an independent comic personality coming out of the dummy.<br /><br />For Fields there are many choice moments too. His walk, supposedly naked after a shower, across the circus grounds - hidden behind people carrying items, or elephants and other animals, until a lady screams and faints (and Fields is finally physically revealed to the audience) is a gem. So is his wrecking the Bel-Goodies engagement party, first by his mad ping pong match, and then by his insistence of telling the story of how his life was saved once by an intelligent rattlesnake (not realizing that Mrs. Bel-Goody hates even the mention of snakes). His interactions with the circus staff, with the idiotic Grady Sutton, with labor union organizer Edward Brophy, and with the various people buying tickets for the circus, or for that matter mispronouncing his name as \"Larceny Whipsnake\" are priceless. So is his own attempt at ventriloquism: he does it so you can\\'t see his lips move, but you just can\\'t believe he is throwing his voice. Well he is throwing dust or something else at that moment.<br /><br />But it is his running confrontations with McCarthy, some of which he actually loses (he has one where he has to bribe Charlie at one point to keep quiet) that maintains the audience\\'s attention. The film is one of Fields\\' best ones, and deservedly retains it\\'s popularity to this day.',\n",

I admit I haven't read the book, but I am the sort of person who likes to judge adaptations on their own merits. The film does look phenomenal, the set design is intricately crafted and the costumes are beautiful. And the special effects are mind-blowing, not the best special effects ever but not the worst, far from it. The soundtrack is also rousing and fun, the story is intriguing, the script is decent and the acting is very well done. Both Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan(the better of the two) give appealing lead performances while Amy/Catherine Quinn is very cute as Lina's little sister Poppy. Bill Murray is deviously obnoxious as the slob of a mayor if there ever was one. However, despite the impressive visuals and performances, there are some problems. One is that while Tim Robbins is a good actor, he is given little to do as Doon's father. Second, the ending felt rather abrupt, the film could've done with a more rounded finish. Thirdly, the pacing is rather slow and drawn out at times particularly in the middle half. This is probably not helped by the occasionally sluggish direction.

In fact, more often than not directors present the past in this manner. Rough Riders is an honest movie that lets the past speak for itself with no apologies. Teddy Roosevelt and his rather diverse band of recruits believed that they were going to Cuba to save the Cuban people from an evil and exploitive Spanish colonial government. Tom Berenger completely buries himself in the character of Teddy Roosevelt without the parody that often accompanies the part. He is surrounded by a cast of excellent actors from Gary Busey as General Joe Wheeler to George Hamilton as William Randolph Hurst. Sam Elliot, Francesco Quinn, and Brad Johnson are fictional characters used to represent the range of ordinary men who followed Roosevelt. Chris Noth, Holt McCallany, and James Parke are the wealthy scions of the Wadsworth, Fish and Tiffany families. I especially liked Nick Chinlund as Frederick Remington and Adam Storke as Stephen Crane. Except for Hurst and Wheeler, these men went into the war dreaming of honor and adventure. They saw themselves as heroes going off to save the Cuban people. They were men who quoted Shakespeare\\'s Henry V \"we happy few\" and believed it implicitly.

              " b\"If you're going to watch a Jeff Chandler western, this is the one to see. I'd hestitate to call it a masterpiece, but it's a damn good try. Produced and directed by the team of Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, it is a tale of conflicting loyalties, megalomania, love, hate and a number of other issues I can't remember, in pre-Civil War Kansas on the eve of the Civil War. Star Jeff Chandler, who portrays the megalomaniacal but withal personally decent and charismatic bad guy, is quite good here. He had spent a decade in action pictures and romances, with an occasional comedy thrown in for good measure, and yet had not achieved major stardom. A mid-level star of the kind of medium grade movie that was going out of fashion, he was on the verge of becoming an anachronism; and had he not died a couple of years after this film one wonders what would have happened to him and his career. In The Jayhawkers he shows what he might have become: a fine, commanding, aristocratic character actor.<br /><br />As the second-billed good guy, Fess Parker, fresh from his triumph as Davy Crockett a few years earlier, was attempting a mainstream, post-Disney career. Low-key and phlegmatic, and not without appeal, he lacks the edge of a Mitchum that might have propelled him into the big leagues, and is for the most part an uninteresting hero. Nicole Maurey is the incongruously Gallic love interest, and one can't help be curious as to why she was cast in this film. She was a lovely young woman, but way out of place here.<br /><br />Loyal Griggs color photography is as good as his work in Shane, and far less mannered. The music of Jerome Moross is stirring and in its way as good as anything Dimitri Tiomkin ever did. With its larger than life good-bad guy, and reasonable (for a movie) historical accuracy, this could have been a major film. The problem with it is that though Panama and Frank were quite good at light comedy, they were inexperienced in the western genre. Frank does a good, derivative job of drawing from Ford and Hawkes; and there are some breathtaking vistas. There is even a touch of Nicholas Ray in his creative and interesting use of interiors, especially the main hideout. And Chandler gives an at times daring performance, with occasional lapses into mild effeminacy in his vocalizing and posture, his work is well-rounded and sophisticated, suggesting that his character's feeling for Parker is more than just friendship. Alas, this daring aspect of the story is never gone into with any depth or insight, and the result the movie is a near-miss, but a fascinating one.\",\n",

Afterwards, I just have to assume that the rest of the films of the 70s were rotten for this to one of the best! Most of the reason I disliked this movie was that it seemed like every second was being created by someone with ADD,...perhaps even ADD as well as crack! That's because there are no quiet moments--only scenes where practically everyone is talking at the same time and it seemed like they were trying to cram 3000 minutes of film into one movie. And because of this, after a while I just wanted it to stop. While some might be amused by this, it just seemed overwhelming and annoying.<br /><br />It's funny--I have never liked Country music, but I really felt sorry for the people of Nashville because the movie seemed to paint them so poorly--like some sort of freak show.

David Lloyd George (The British Prime Minister) and Douglas Haig (The General commanding the British Army) hated each other and after the war DLG got his memoirs into print very quickly - this led to the myth that the British Army was led by bungling officers and sacrificed for nothing.<br /><br />This show plays on that myth - In an extremely funny way. Alas - it also helps rob the British Army of its finest victory. <br /><br />Despite that I love this show - they visit so many of the controversial sides of this conflict in what is at times a side achingly funny way. The end is especially poignant.\",\n",
              " b\"A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.\",\n",

              " b'This was my second run at Oriental horror films and unlike the first try (some movie about spirals) I actually enjoyed this one. I have a hard time trusting anyone who says they knew the ending, it was pretty well disguised through most of the movie. In addition it was a unique blend of video game and movie. Things going against it were the colors and the fast-forward thing that both of the Japanese horror movies have had. I would highly recommend subtitles over the dubbed in English as the subtitles seem to make more sense and the dubbing gives the movie an undesired godzilla effect. A little on the artsy side but definitely accomplishes good suspense. 8/10 for an enjoyable time watching the movie.',\n",
              " b'Decidedly adult-oriented slapstick-comedy, though it was originally marketed towards the younger crowds, that has two very different brothers (played by comedians Nathan Lane and Lee Evans) suddenly left broke and homeless directly resulting from a couple of disturbing and rather unfunny circumstances. By what seems like pure luck the bumbling brothers inherit a dilapidated mansion at just the right time from their wealthy industrialist father (played by William Hickey) who has just recently passed away. Apparently the house, as they soon find out, was built by some well-known architect in the mid-nineteenth century ultimately making it very valuable and highly sought-after by a number of collectors. In the process of attempting to clean the place up so as to hold a big auction in it with hopes of selling it to the highest and wealthiest bidder the two men realize (much to their dismay) that the house\\'s oldest resident, a tiny little mouse, is unwilling to give up his much loved abode without a fight! From that basic plot hilarity is supposed to ensue, but for a number of reasons it rarely does! One of the many things that bothered me about this flick and made it hard for me to laugh was the big fact that it was so dark, dank and just way too atmospheric for it\\'s own good. Meaning that the seemingly unnamed time-period and or place that it\\'s set in is far too unpleasant, grimy and gritty for an out-and-out comedy, let alone a kid\\'s film! In fact it kind of reminds me of the sometimes graphic and violent \"Delicatessen\" and \"The City Of Lost Children\"...dark and amoral, with a fairy-tale like theme and enormous and meticulous set designs. However, unlike those two films this one was inappropriately aimed towards children via the cartoon-like slapstick comedy reminiscent of the old \"Wily Coyote and The Road Runner\" and sorry but I gotta say it, \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons. Some curious cameos are also featured here from a number of character actors that are passable considering all, though to be honest I\\'m still scratching my head as to why any of them would have actually made appearances in this flick in the first place; the actors I\\'m in reference to are: Maury Chakin, Christopher Walkin (!?), the late Michael Jeter, the late William Hickey who passed away shortly after this film wrapped and who\\'s memory it is dedicated to in the end credits, and Vicki Lewis. Overall, \"Mousehunt\" is not the worst film you could ever see that\\'s for sure. However, in my opinion and this is just my opinion mind you, I don\\'t think that it\\'s really too fit for the kiddies out there frankly. Though, a number of the adult\\'s are likely to get a kick out of this to a degree more or less, but I don\\'t think that many of them will find it to be completely fall-down hilarious by any means.

              " b\"I've read the reviews on this website and can only conclude that the two Johns involved with this movie (Travolta and Woo) must have paid a lot of people a lot of money to register with IMDb and write 10-star reviews to balance out the more valid 1 and 2-star reviews. This movie is absolutely atrocious in every aspect: directing, acting, special effects, dialog, plot-line, you name it. If Travolta were playing his role more tongue-in-cheek and the movie itself were touted as a comedy, then it might be palatable. But the movie and actor both appear to be actually taking themselves seriously, and the result is something that is just dreadful to watch. It took all my strength to actually see it through to the end all the while hoping that something redeeming would happen. It did not. Do not waste your time by seeing this movie. Use the two hours to weed your garden, mow your lawn, change the cat litter, or wash the windows. Any of those things are more enjoyable than sitting through this.\",\n",

I was treated to a really amazing beat 'em up fest. Billy Blanks and Roddy Piper sure know how to kick some butt.<br /><br />The movie centers around veteran police office Frank Rossi, played by Piper, who after his partner Wallace is brutally gutted by a ruthless drug gang, becomes bent on avenging his partner's death. Meanwhile, Billy (Played by Billy Blanks), an ex-Special Forces agent, is trying to protect his sister from the same gang, lead by Kasajian, played brilliantly by Nigel Bennett. Rossi and Billy eventually team up after a number of confrontations when Billy's sister and Rossi's reporter girlfriend Helen (Played by Bobbie Phillips) are kidnapped by Kasajian's gang.<br /><br />This movie really knows how to deliver. It's sad that there is really not that large of a following, but we can always hope that it will gain more cult recognition in the future. I hope Universal considers releasing a DVD of this movie someday, in widescreen.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />EXTRAS: The tape contains a trailer for Mr. Write (1994) before the movie starts.\",\n",

That was acceptable at the time the film was made, when people were so thrilled to see a western in color, but nowadays it just looks very primitive. Nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns, it is entertaining, the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that recently came out.

A previous comment does a good job of pointing out the errors in the added period footage.<br /><br />It was a good introduction into a serial murderer I'd never heard of. It was also a disgusting overly dramatized exercise in attempting to concentrate more on the gross out factor than reporting the facts. Not content to describe once how good certain parts of a child's body were when roasted and eaten, it describes the heinous deeds in fact and again in a first person voice-over narrated by an actor playing Albert Fish.<br /><br />For shock affect it delved into ramming the details of his crimes down the throat of the viewer, again and again. At the expense of his victims and their families the film wallows in filth and was offensive in the extreme because of it. Either we're too stupid to digest the horror of his acts, or sales were forefront and above any other consideration the film makers claim.<br /><br />It's not a documentary. A documentary informs us of real events without trying to sicken people with fictitious scenes added catering to the director's opinion of what took place. That's fiction. It's not a movie, in a movie you can accept that 'based on' gives the director license to add whatever he thinks will sell. It is a sick perverted film on a sick perverted killer but that not being enough, it approaches the same type of sick twisted deeds on film, that Fish did in person. In this, the film makers succeed in showing their perverted intention on wringing out every last drop of human suffering in their own race for sales.<br /><br />Joe Coleman, obviously delighted to lay claim to notoriety by surrounding himself with the artifacts of the infamous and psychotic members of our society, sits smugly as he tells us he's thrilled to have the original letter sent to one victim's family, describing what Fish did to their child. How he was 'meant' to have it. Most serial murderers take trophies and this particular derelict of humanity, Coleman, does the same here, living with the material surrounding the worst part of themselves humanity has to offer. If any proof was needed for what I'm saying here, it's in the repeated interviews with this piece of crap. His sole participation in this film should have been only in examining this letter. Instead we're treated to repeated interview segments with no other reason than to try and help sell this presentation of crap.<br /><br />These flaws ruin what could have been a remarkable recounting of Fish's deeds. The makers of this prostituted themselves for sales and in doing so, reflect a watered down mirror of the same sort of sickness Fish succumbed to. It's a perverted reporting of a perverted person and because of this they have more in common with this man than they may want to realize.\",\n",

The makers of this film should consider themselves lucky, as I doubt that too many others would last even that long. From the very first scene, less than 10 seconds into the movie, you know that you're in for a wild time of melodrama, overacting, bad script, and really bad set design/location and costume.<br /><br />One of the cabins featured prominently in the start looks like something you might see as the backdrop in a J.

              " b\"First off, I'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the Best Picture Academy Award was 'Gigi' in 1958. That is misinformation as 'West Side Story' won in 1962, 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music' won the year after that. That said, this film is absolutely fantastic! The story from the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version. However, I don't mind. In fact, I rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does. I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh. I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office. The underscore for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any film version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is worked out much better than he is in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest, most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy.' I always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs. It looks awful and cheesy, especially when they're dancing at the London Meat Co. They should've just done regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.\",\n",
              " b'This exquisitely photographed film portrays the cultural clash between Europeans (in this case the Europeans happen to be French) and various native tribes in seventeenth century North America without romanticizing either French culture or that of the native peoples.<br /><br />Perhaps the most striking feature of this film from my perspective was utter arrogance of the Europeans to come into a wild country presuming the superiority of their way of life over that of the indigenous peoples. No character seemed to understand that better than Father LaForgue, admirably portrayed by Lothaire Bluteau. The good Father soldiers on despite the evidence that his presence in the vast wilderness of North America won\\'t make a whit of difference in his life or in the lives of the people he has vowed to introduce into \"paradise.\" The Algonquin guides worry about their attachment to the \"demon\" LaForgue and wonder whether they shouldn\\'t just kill him. Even LaForgue\\'s young assistant, Daniel, wonders how the presence of a French missionary makes the the native people\\'s lives any better. The Iroquois, who suffer from a harsh depiction in the film, take a more economically-based view of LaForgue -- he and Daniel are seen by the Iroquois as currency to be exchanged for guns.<br /><br />An aside concerning the Iroquois. While the violence depicted in the film is no doubt accurate, what the film does not reveal is that the Iroquois likely became decidedly more hostile when the French began to assist old enemies, such as the Algonquin, in traveling into hunting grounds that had previously been Iroquois territory.<br /><br />But back to LaForgue, whose journey is the primary emphasis of the film. He has journeyed, apparently from a life of some privilege in France, leaving behind a doting mother and (perhaps) a beautiful young woman. He has journeyed away from the \"pleasures of the flesh,\" lingering on the sight of a couple making love in the communal tipi and later admitting to Daniel that he, LaForgue, lusts after the young Alogonquin woman,Annuka, with whom Daniel had already struck up a sexual relationship. He gets lost on the journey in the cathedral-like forest and rejoices and being found by Algonquin hunters, who express some bemusement that the Black Robe got lost in the first place. Finally, he journeys to the Hurons and a village beset by smallpox, where baptism has been sold to the natives as a miracle cure as much as it has a key to salvation.<br /><br />By avoiding the tendency of films depicting Native American life to romanticize, Bruce Beresford has captured more profoundly the daily harsh realities of life for the peoples inhabiting the northeastern portion of North America at the arrivals of the first trickling of Europeans. Neither way of life is ultimately depicted as superior to the other: each simply is. This is not a \"feel-good\" film. Instead it is a realistic, thought-provoking tale of a journey of a man, of cultures, and of life itself. Simply a brilliant film.',\n",
              " b'Knowing that Lon Chaney Jr. played the Wolf Man and that Burgess Meredith played Penguin on the old \"Batman\" TV series (plus Rocky\\'s trainer), it might seem hard to imagine them co-starring in a serious movie. But \"Of Mice and Men\" comes out very well done. In this adaptation of John Steinbeck\\'s novel, the two actors bring to life the retarded Lennie Small and the self-standing George Milton, respectively. On the farm where they get hired, one can easily see the hierarchy inherent in society: the workers forced to do the most degrading labor; the African-American ostracized from everyone else; the Chinese servant; and the woman (Betty Field) forbidden from having her own life. In the midst of everything, George has to look after Lennie, who proves very dangerous to himself and others.<br /><br />So, this is definitely a movie that I recommend. Even if Betty Field\\'s performance comes across as mildly silly, that doesn\\'t dampen the movie. Very well done.',\n",

              " b'Film can be the most fun.<br /><br />One of the most interesting things about film is how we use them to work out who we are. I\\'m interested in certain notions of complex abstract reasoning, but the simpler, more obvious stuff is fun too. One of those \"simple\" things is national identity. And there is hardly a better case than how the British defined themselves during the great war. While France rolled over and most Europeans were left to define themselves as humans instead of citizens, the English really turned to film as a nation.<br /><br />One of the most interesting appropriations was Sherlock Holmes. He has a singular importance in the history of literature, both in terms of placing a discoverer of story in the story, and in terms of being a representative of the (then) new notion that people are motivated and act rationally.<br /><br />So any movie with Holmes in it, no matter how casual, is loaded, and this one is loaded by bulldozers. Holmes is transported from Victorian times to then modern times. His nemesis here is the guy who played his old opponent: Moriarty. <br /><br />And there are other transpositions as well. Holmes\\' interest in science is transformed to a focus on technology, here microfilm, high tech for the time. And the action \\xc2\\x97 after some homeland establishing shots (including a loving mother) \\xc2\\x97 is transported from the UK to the US. And that\\'s the interesting part, because when you are defining your nature, you have the choice by defining it against others.<br /><br />In this case, we have a parade of American stereotypes. Since it was absolutely clear that the Americans were saving the Brits from extinction, this is done with less edge than usual. But we still have the bullmoose loud senator, the dippy but earnest girlie, the solid naval officer and such. These are woven around landmarks of Washington.<br /><br />But one stereotype is particularly of interest. In the 40\\'s in the US, black men were railroad porters. By a lucky accident, it was a way to earn decent money, be relatively cosmopolitan but still stay in a role of servitude. These were Jim Crow days in the US, a bad time, a time of canker. So depicting the necessary black man in this film was handled with some sensitivity. The British filmmakers followed the form of polite deference, but with less bowing and scraping than in an America movie of the era. <br /><br />But check out who plays the black porter. He\\'s George Muse, perhaps the least servile black man in the business at the time, someone who would go on to earn a doctorate. Someone who refused to give an inch on basic respect. I think the Brits in charge of production, who did the US portions in California with DC projected on screens behind, would have been amused.

              " b'This is the first time I have written a comment on IMDb in all the years I have used it avidly to search for worthy videos to watch. I am writing it not because there is not enough comments already for this wonderful series, but to additionally help you decide if you should invest a whopping 54 hours of your life on watching one drama! Since this is aimed at convincing you why you should watch it, I will keep spoilers to a minimum.<br /><br />So how did I get involved with it? I was searching for worthy Korean TV series to watch after having seen the more contemporary setting drama such as Stairway To Heaven, which is highly recommended. When I came across this, although rated highly by others, I shy-ed away from it for the same reason above ... I just couldn\\'t imagine how this kind of drama can entice me. But...someone I know asked if I have it to lent them due to the fact I told people I watched Korean Drams. I did not in spite of my collection of top DVD titles. I decided to get it just to find out what it was all about. At the time, IMDb did not have this title rated to assist in my decision.<br /><br />Episode one was interesting. Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety. If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode 3, then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible). The actors/actresses are handsome/pretty, but that is not why I continued.<br /><br />The first set of DVDs I purchased was made in China and had OK English translation. The problem with the English translation, while subtle, surfaced more in the second half, as one can tell they are not done by the same person(s). An anal movie-buff that I am, I sold it and bought the YesAsia edition, more expensive but has much better translation (a very prominent example would be: Palace Girl in the China Edition is Court Lady in the YesAsia edition -- while Palace Girl is the \"literal\" translation, the proper equivalent by title is Court Lady). The picture quality is also better. In fact, my wife commented that Jang-Geum (grown up) is not as pretty as in the China version now that she can see the imperfections on her face close up.... So I ended up spending yet another 54 hours re-watching...but it was worth it...because the translation clarified things that otherwise would have been lost as \"cultural differences.\" This is the set that will remain in my library as one of the rare \"worthy\" TV dramas to collect in its original form. By the way, the China edition in the green box has bonus materials of interview with some of the cast members as well as the last 7 days of filming -- even though there is no English subtitle on the bonus materials, it was still quite enjoyable to see how the cast looked in \"modern\" attire and their reaction to the questions! :)<br /><br />With so many TV programs trying to \"buy\" an audience with \"sex, violence, and improper language (lack of respect)\" screen time nowadays, it is truly refreshing to see something that not only serves to entertain but also educate at the same time without emphasis on sex and violence! It is little wonder that this series has swept away audiences all over and realigned some of the younger generation to the ideals that seem to be eroding away in the modern world.<br /><br />In closing, none of the episodes disappointed and they were all enjoyable, but it is just a small few minutes here and there of extra details that seem to drag a bit in the first 10 episodes. In fact, I have a feeling that if you are KOREAN you will probably not feel the drag due to your ability to relate those details better than non-KOREANs like me.<br /><br />The quality of research that has gone into making this production (the cuisines and the medicines) is impressive and educational. The music - excellent. Combined with the singular vision of one director and one writer for this drama, it is a COMPLETE experience that, in short, will enrich the lives of anyone who is open-minded and willing to invest the time to watch it.<br /><br />Please let me know if my comment is helpful to you. Thanks!<br /><br />P.S.

I expected it to provide a cinematic version of what I already knew of the Chun Li persona, and it failed to provide in every way.<br /><br />First off, Kristen Kreuk as Chun Li. What where they thinking! There are hundreds of highly skilled Asian actors that could have been casted in a better fashion. Bison/Balrog (lol confusing) kept reminding me of the Green Mile, the death sentenced good guy with a heart of gold. Now he is some buffed punchbag, mmm. This leads to the horrible, horrible accents that the actors had when they were talking in an Asian language. Seriously, UGH!.<br /><br />The story itself was shallow, bad bad special effects. (Spinning Bird Kick in the club scene, are you serious? 20 years ago they were able to make it look better in a video game. 30 years ago they made it look better in a Kung Fu movie, get real.<br /><br />The story about her revenge on Bison is shallow. She gets her revenge in a way, but it's not satisfying at all.<br /><br />Top it all off with cheesy one-liner upon one-liner, bad acting, bad casting and you got yourself a turdcake that the entire audience has to take a bite off.<br /><br />F--, see me after class.\",\n",
              " b'I watched this movie with skepticism but I have to admit I was wrong. This is a powerful movie and it left me drained out by the time it got over. The last 15 to 20 minutes are sure to move even the cold hearted so,I am surprised and saddened that there are still some folks here at the forum fighting over its anti/pro Muslim/Serbian credentials.<br /><br />There is no winner in any war - only despair & death and at times, a faint glimmer of hope. Saviour depicts this with astonishing realism and at times,is difficult to watch but I guess that what war is all about. Dennis Quaid gives an Oscar winning performance and considering, the fact that Oliver Stone produced this, it has a antiwar platoonesque feel to it.',\n",
              " b\"I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clich\\xc3\\xa9s in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.\",\n",
              " b'Do you know when you look at your collection of old, videotaped movies, and realize that there are some that you\\'ve only seen once or twice, and you can\\'t remember if they\\'re worth the time it takes to see them? The Alibi is/was one of those films; I found it, not long ago, and decided I might as well give it a chance. I\\'m not entirely sure if I\\'m happy with my decision... on one hand, the film is really, really bad, on the other, now I have another free tape... yeah, you get it. The plot is predictable and not in any way original. The pacing is bad. The acting is bad, but that\\'s not really surprising, seeing as the two leads are former soap-opera stars... they\\'re used to overact. The characters are poorly written clich\\xc3\\xa9s. The film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress me(through film): court scenes. Even those don\\'t elicit one single emotion for or against any of the cardboard-thin characters. The film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever... even the dialog is bad. The thing is, it\\'s so full of clich\\xc3\\xa9s that it\\'s laughable. And that\\'s the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 1/10: the(albeit unintentionally so) comic relief of the many clich\\xc3\\xa9s and stereotypes. I didn\\'t pay very much attention to the film, but just about every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. One final note: I considered using the line \"Tori Spelling can\\'t act\" as a one line summary, but I guess everyone knows that, so I opted for the current one, seeing as it\\'s more informative. All in all, a thoroughly bad film, but not the worst if you\\'ve got nothing else to do and if it\\'s on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it. 3/10',\n",
              " b'I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but thought \"Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching\". I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so inept, clich\\xc3\\xa9d and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow\\'s ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering \"What were they thinking?\". Very, very sad that it has come to this. Don\\'t waste your time.',\n",
              " b'I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the\\xc2\\xa0\"usual gang\" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I\\'m sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where\\'s Poppa?) I think it\\'s his crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)',\n",

Some scenes are very funny!! especially the car scene, Were echavaria Gives a great ricky martin impression(i laughed my ass off) you have to keep in mind that this was a pretty low Budget production, so all the credits go to the actors who really keep this one moving!!

Melba and Dottie are better people (and therefore better characters) than most down and outs in movies these days. The movie has a stunning lack of agenda - which is meant as a compliment in that it's emotional payoffs are earned and natural as opposed to being sickly or cynical. Bravo! Why can't they make sequels to little films with epic themes - this plays as a sort of Odyessy trailer park style. Plus, lets give the casting some points for inspiration. I know this movie is coming out on DVD soon, so everybody look out for it - it's a keeper.\",\n",
              " b'I saw Scrapple at the 1998 Breckenridge Film Fest. The description of the film read, \"Pigs, drugs, and ski bums.\" I was intrigued, to say the least, by what would be my favorite film of the festival.<br /><br />The opening credit scenes had me believing I was watching a movie that was filmed in the mid \\'70s. By the second scene I knew I was in for a great film. Having lived in ski towns for the past 10 years, I can safely say that Scapple does an outstanding job of relaying the universal, timeless truisms of ski town life.<br /><br />Entertaining, funny, and cinematically beautiful, the film sends a small message that hits close to home. During the story we fall in love with Al Dean, the king of blind luck, in his efforts to make things right.<br /><br />This is a film that was put together remarkably well, especially for a first time, independent project. After seeing a movie like Scrapple, one wonders how this film isn\\'t being distributed on a national level, when so many undeserving movies are. I suppose blame lies in the unenlightened viewing public and not in the quality of the film, as Scrapple is the most underrated film I have yet to see.<br /><br />Kudos to the Hanson brothers for their grassroots efforts to get this movie seen by appreciative moviegoers.',\n",
              " b\"This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either. But some observations:<br /><br />1. If the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it is only a matter of lousy film-making, not giving a damn about being coherent.<br /><br />2. We don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully (=bombastically) delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext \\xc2\\x96 just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in.<br /><br />3. Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago \\xc2\\x96 and without needlessly humiliating his actors.<br /><br />4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary-schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondary-school level of skill. If that was the point, the point sucked.\",\n",
              " b'It seems like the only comments here are very negative. I found it rather entertaining, maybe it did not fully live up to the reviews but most of the history works. I think that both the lead characters are well played by Niels Olsen and Sidse Babett Knudsen and Lars Kaalund is great as the friend of Niller. Sofie Gr\\xc3\\xa5b\\xc3\\xb8l made toes crumble but not because of bad play but because the character she played was so embarrassing clumbsy. But if people prefer movies like \"Op p\\xc3\\xa5 fars hat\" and \"kampen om den r\\xc3\\xb8de ko\" then I come short of arguments.',\n",
              " b\"Directed by Michael Winner and starring the late Charles Bronson in the lead role, this is a gritty inner city revenge film which comes off as a competent and effective social statement.<br /><br />Paul Kersey (Bronson) is a liberal architect living in a not so nice, crime ridden area of the city. He lives with his wife and daughter, who are brutally attacked whilst at home by 3 sadistic street trash thugs (a young Jeff Goldblum is one of them) whilst he is out. The wife is beaten into unconsciousness before later dying in hospital, and the daughter is sexually assaulted and goes into a catatonic state as a result of the shock.<br /><br />It is this terrible event which changes Kerseys perception of law and order. He starts to change his way of thinking, starts to change his way of acting. He sees an overstretched police force struggling with the city's crime and social decay, and feels he, just one man, can make a difference. Kersey soon enough takes to the streets, never to look for trouble, but to let trouble come to him, and deal with it directly in his own way! He is tired of being the decent citizen who shakes their head at the morning paper, talks amongst friends but does nothing to change what he sees. The film becomes better still as the police find themselves under pressure with the recent vigilante killings, and the media report that once helpless victims are fighting back against their attackers inspired by this new rebel.<br /><br />This is one of those films that has had a lasting effect on me, and I remember being quite shaken after watching it. It seems so real as Kersey could just as easily be a next door neighbour or uncle, he is no hulking giant with an arsenal of weaponry or superpowers, no fearless warrior who can't be scratched...he is just another man trying to make a living. Cleverly directed, well acted and graphic when it has to be, this is a great film and serves its purpose well. Gripping, raw and impactive, this is one of Bronson greatest films, and stands as a classic.\",\n",
              " b\"One of the major problems with being a film fan, or a British film fan for that matter, is the deep sense of embarrassment whenever a new British film is released, because it's almost always bad. But alas, this is not the case with Michael Winterbottom's fascinating Wonderland. Here Winterbottom has gone back to the roots of the Ken Loach, Mike Leigh genre of kitchen-sink drama, crossing it with the narrative feel of Robert Altman, and the free-from style of Lars von Trier, creating in the process a new and deeply affecting tale of three south London sister over the course of one weekend (three days). The great thing about this is, briefly, for the course of the film anyway, British cinema has it's own identity. The BIG brit films of the last few years have all been tired American knock-offs, from Guy Ritchie's pathetic lock-stock and Snatch, to the empty romanticised views depicted in films like Four Wedding and Notting Hill. Wonderland gives an authentic view of London, without the glamour but with much more pathos, and fully developed characters. <br /><br />The ensemble cast of rising character actors are perfectly put together, they may not be familiar to some audiences even in the UK, but the work of the three female leads, McKee, Parker and Henderson are given fine support from the men, Ian Hart, John Simm and David Fahm. The cinema-verite style gives the film a strong realism, making some the more depressing scenes almost un-watchable, but Winterbottom and writer Laurence Coriat should be commended for trying something different within the confines of the ever-predictable British Film Industry (\\xc2\\x99). It sadness me that this film is so underrated, whilst average films like Billy Elliot gather a barrage of Oscar and Bafta nominations, I don't remember Wonderland getting a mention. This is by far the best British film I've seen in a long time, not a perfect film by any means, one flaw would be that some of the characters are pushed to the background, never getting a chance to fully shine, but a film this good is a rare thing. See it now you won't regret it. 9/10<br /><br />\",\n",
              " b'Greetings again from the darkness. Much anticipated, twisted comedy from writer/director Richard Shepard is a coming out party for Pierce Brosnan the actor. That Bond guy is gone. This new guy is something else entirely!! Have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, \"Facilitator\" ... and is anything but pretty! Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear is the straight guy to Brosnan\\'s comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. Hope Davis has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear\\'s wife (what\\'s with her name \"Bean\"?) who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room.<br /><br />The visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, racetrack and Denver suburb. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This one is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film-making, it could be for you.',\n",

I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start! It is interminable! So \"Arty\" it hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi film I have watched. Apparently he makes films by the dozen and, if they are all pretentious w@nk like this, I suspect it will be the last.<br /><br />I\\'m not against Pretentious w@nk.

              " b'It really doesn\\'t matter that Superman comic books are unbelievably naive and their target is ten year old. What matters is that \"Superman Returns\" is bad movie. <br /><br />In the beginning,a question for You Dear Readers, how many of You actually believe that Superman will be defeated by bald Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Just as I thought. No spoilers here. So let\\'s get to some major issues right now.<br /><br />Firstly, this movie looks like commercial (scene in the bar with Superman/Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is only scene which looks as it supposed to). Imagine commercial of Superman, two and half hour long. Let\\'s be serious this isn\\'t \"Amadeus\" or \"The Departed\". You actually feel, that this movie is way too long. And special effects are not so special by the way.<br /><br />Secondly, scenario is silly. Sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic, in cinema it looks just stupid. And it\\'s like that in this case. Of course dialogs are disgrace. I can\\'t believe somebody took money to write them. How many times we will be fed with villain making speeches? How many times laws of physics will be raped? (Jesus, it\\'s not only the matter of Superman\\'s strength but also a resistance of materials his dealing with.) How many times Lois Lane will be fooled by Kent? How many times Hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books? Since there\\'s hard to make a good story, why having a weak story for a starter? It just doesn\\'t work. Guys, get a grip. Try harder, please. Or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. I got the feeling that WGA is permanently on strike. No offense. I\\'m not questioning the lame money those people are paid, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case there is no quality at all. (At this point You may ask yourself: is it that bad? Yes it is.)<br /><br />Thirdly, acting is weak, which is quite a surprise since Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects) is directing. Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he\\'s the only one. Audience is rather not in the mood for jokes. Thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality, with clear motivations but also with doubts, fears, some depth. In this case nobody did that job, and characters aren\\'t really interesting.<br /><br />Finally, whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody. Second unit is so bad that attracts attention, since there\\'s nothing interesting going on on screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), the funnier it gets (but it isn\\'t laugh You could expect).<br /><br />Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /><br />This particular movie, ladies and gents, is camp. Don\\'t waste Your time and don\\'t waste Your money too. Stay home, read a book.',\n",

RAWHIDE is a great example and contains many reasons for its general obscurity.<br /><br />Things go wrong the moment Susan Hayward arrives on the scene. This woman cannot act and her character is completely overbearing and obnoxious.<br /><br />This is simply a badly written story made worse by bizarre performances by Hugh Marlowe, Dean Jagger, George Tobias and the thoroughly freakish Jack Elam who is either the highlight or the low-light of the film.<br /><br />Jack Elam gives all to his role with his eyes bugging out, licking his lips and his teeth, sticking out his tongue and his jaw and positioning his head in every freakish position that he can. And he gets close-ups! All he needed was to have his head spin around a la Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST.<br /><br />Hugh Marlowe is awful and doesn't seem to realize he is in a movie.<br /><br />Dean Jagger mutters much of the time as the semi-simpleton of Marlowe's band of gold robbers.<br /><br />George Tobias plays an ethnic in the manner of El Brendel, yet looking like Alfonso Bedoya in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.<br /><br />Tyrone Power does the best of all with a cookie-cutter character.<br /><br />On the other hand, the location shooting in Lone Pine is very attractive and the digital restoration made the image quality look near to real life, but in black and white.<br /><br />I can't envision myself ever watching this grueling film again.\",\n",

I won't give a synopsis of the movie as others have always done it adequately. I won't liken it to other movies as it stands quite clearly on its own. Transgressing shock horror and mutilations for the fear of what cant be seen, and that resides not only in the woods alone. I love the way the woods intruded on the school with vines and leaves on the walls and the floor. And the leaves always present on the teachers hair. Patricia Clarkson does a beautifully understated job as the headmistress, and her quiet voice doing a lot more to scare me than a lot of yelling and overbearing attitudes of other films. Agnes is great as the Heroine Heather, and I found myself totally captivated by her style. Her friend Marcy was a lovely touch and the vocals for the part (whether her or not) were stunning. The stillness was also an attraction, never hurrying, like trees, still and composed.

This movie starts out with Lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home.

Demonic Toys, Wax Works and all of the Puppet Masters are so lame now. Even though years before I was terrified!!!! It's really weird 2 look back on all the things that scared u when u were younger, and look at them now. All I can do is laugh at this corny crap! It's just so weird. It was around the time that killer dolls were frighting. But Chucky is still watchable. He's still somewhat creepy I guess, but now it's nothing but good old humor!! I do however suggest that u rent this film or even buy it if u want 2 watch a comedy. It should be fun 2 sit around with friends and laugh at this movie. Besides that the plot was awful and the effects were useless, u could find something good about it if u look hard enough. But me? Absolutely not, I still can't believe this use 2 give me goose bumps!\",\n",
              " b'This was an excellent movie. I personally think it should have been put in the movie theater Well I shouldn\\'t take it that far but it was a good movie. My Favorite actor in Subway Stories actually was Danny Hoch. I\\'m not even sure why, I think it was because he was cool and laid back. Where as his friend was very hype kind of rowdy and a little drunk. But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well. I also think it was the best story out of all ten stories, which is called \"HONEY GETTER\". The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting. I checked out all the scenes where the stories were shot, and it kind of Felt as if I was in the movie it self, feeling weird like I was in my own little world. Another thing I did was went to the spot where the movie first comes on from the blimp look. It took me a while to find it but I finally did, and the spot that they show or I should say the view is just right above Union Square. Because if you look real carefully at your tv, you\\'ll notice the foot locker and the dirt on the side which I believe now is a movie theatre called United Artists. Well that pretty much concludes my little story and I enjoyed sharing, I hope maybe you\\'ll notice something in the movie I didn\\'t. And just one last thing I hope that this movie comes out on DVD I can\\'t seem to find it anywhere.',\n",

I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living. <br /><br />Some of the scenes are very funny. I don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. <br /><br />Some of the dresses are really beautiful, pity the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in colour. The way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that. <br /><br />Watch it as soon as you can, and tell your friends about it.\",\n",

              " b'The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clich\\xc3\\xa9s. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br /><br />The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri\\'s seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man\\'s impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film\\'s conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en\\'s surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en\\'s poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br /><br />Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90\\'s. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br /><br />Score 10/10',\n",

I watched \"Silverado\" for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst Western I have ever watched. The acting was terrible all around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing. The only good part I can think of is the good-looking cantina girl. The very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length. This movie wasn\\'t even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store. I felt like I was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing. Only reason I finished it was because I hate to not see a movie through to the end. I turned it off half way through because it was so bad. To the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to Westerns.',\n",
              " b'This is a CGI animated film based upon a French 2D animated series. The series ran briefly on Cartoon Network, but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people I know going \"Huh?\" This is the story of Lian-Chu, the kind heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brains of the operation, who along with Hector their fire farting dragon,he\\'s more like a dog. Travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid. Into their lives comes Zoe, the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind. It seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes. In desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe of course tags along...<br /><br />What can I say other then why is this film hiding under a rock? This is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely Oscar contender. Its a beautifully designed, fantastic looking film (The world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures) that constantly had me going \"Wow\" at it. The English Voice cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I\\'ve ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is first rate. Equally great is the script which doesn\\'t talk down to its audience, using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films (not Disney nor Pixar). Its all really well done.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No, some of the bits go on too long, but at the same time its is damn entertaining.<br /><br />If you get the chance see this. Its one of the better animated films from 2008, and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009.',\n",
              " b'A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy/Canada 1977).<br /><br />Every once in a while, you come across a film that really touches a nerve. This one offers a very simple premise, almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It\\'s surprising Ettore Scola\\'s \"Una giornate particulare\" is relatively unheralded, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it \\'rubbish\\' and Leonard Maltin, somewhat milder, \\'pleasant but trifling.\\' I disagree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I\\'ve seen. The cinematography is distinctly unflashy, even a bit bland, and the storyline straightforward, which might explain the film\\'s relative unpopularity. Considering late \\'70s audiences weren\\'t exactly spoiled with great Italian films, it\\'s even stranger this one didn\\'t really catch on with the critics.<br /><br />The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive footage from Hitler\\'s visit to Italy on may 8th 1938. Set against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building. One day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbour Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies. He is well-mannered, cultured and soon she is attracted to him. During the whole film, we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. After the opening scene, the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist (hypermodern at the time) apartment block, seemingly searching for our main characters, whom we haven\\'t met yet. <br /><br />Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles, all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren\\'s husband, but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I figure his voice must have been dubbed, since he\\'s not of Italian descent and never lived there, to my knowledge, so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian. If his voice has been dubbed, I didn\\'t notice at all. On the contrary, he\\'s completely believable as an Italian, even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are outstanding, the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn\\'t come off as overly pretentious but works completely. Don\\'t miss out on this one.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 9/10',\n",

              " b\"Perhaps the first south Asian film that has had such a lasting impression on me, Khamosh Pani has hardly received the glory it truly deserves. Watching the film leaves you senseless for about half an hour and then it knocks all the wind out of you.<br /><br />Khamosh Pani takes the viewer to a small village in Pakistan where life evolves. Specifically it focuses on Ayesha and her son Saleem and their relationship. Ayesha never goes to the village well to draw water while Saleem gets seduced by Islamic fundamentalists and transforms from a love sick puppy to the man he thinks he wants to be.<br /><br />Sabiha Sumar, perhaps one of the best directors in the subcontinent, tells us the story of a small village in Pakistan. With perhaps one of the most powerful issues to deal with, Sumar displays true genius by making everything seem so subtle and hauntingly real. Perhaps, the greatest strength lies in convincing the audience that the statement need not be made in black and white and in this respect Sumar shines.<br /><br />To say that the acting performances were excellent would be the understatement of the century. One watches in amazement at how real and authentic each character is. The mind knows that what it sees are actors and yet it refuses to believe what it knows. Every single character, from an extra to the leads adds to the tremendous energy that the film brings with it. Kirron Kher as Ayesha/Veero is stunning, so much so that one cannot imagine her as anyone else. Aamir Ali Malik is another actor who plays with the audience, seducing them and disturbing them through the course of the film As an Indian separated from the partition by two generations I can't really say that I feel the pain that my mother does when she sees a film such as this, I have heard stories of my grand aunt who was attacked and mutilated by a mob in Lahore when my mothers family had to leave for India. Perhaps my lack of sentimental attachment makes me see it a little more objectively. Khamosh Pani has exposed me to some of this pain and while it may not be my own I can feel it. But the question that arose in my mind is that those that were around when this bloodshed (on both sides) occurred have mostly died or are dying, will we succeeding generations ever know this pain? The pain of leaving behind a wife, killing your own daughter, leaving her to be raped, Living in another country when that which was once a part of you lives somewhere else. How can I fight for this when I don't know what its like? Khamosh Pani made me feel this pain for a few days; perhaps we need more reminders such as these so that we can experience the pain to forget.\",\n",

The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of boring. I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So said we all.\",\n",

If it were made now, it would be slicker than slick, void of soul, with the wretched music of our age providing the soundtrack. Heavy Metal circa 1981 has the texture and imperfect beauty that sustaining, lasting art must possess; think Miles Davis\\' Bi*ches Brew or Sketches of Spain, or the Rolling Stones\\' Exile on Main Street - that\\'s where Heavy Metal lives. It\\'s not perfect, parts of it are quite flawed, but as a whole, even the flaws are beautiful gems to behold, and I tell you, for every voice barking on about Heavy Metal\\'s flaws being too much to take, I say this: you take your Saw and remakes of Texas Chainsaw and The Omen and whatever else your fetid college brains latch onto as broken things that need fixing, and we\\'ll take Heavy Metal and the original versions of the horror movies mentioned and be artistically far richer. But you\\'re not after richness in art, are you? You\\'re after eye-candy and digitally rendered starscapes, aren\\'t you? Yes, you are. And you\\'re beggars with moldy bread because of it.<br /><br />Heavy Metal is a classic, and I\\'ll be first to admit that it\\'s got problems, but believe it or not, problems sometimes add to a classic\\'s being considered a classic in the first place.

Upon her return, she is informed that he has passed away and that it was his wish that she tries to save the arts centre in which she, herself, was once a student. She then finds her best friend, Najma, but she refuses to help her.<br /><br />Directed by Anil Mehta and written by Aditya Chopra, this is a musical genre movie and the songs are memorable, which makes it a change since nowadays, there are only some songs and music that can be hummed to or remembered. The most memorable is the title song itself and off course, with Madhuri Dixit looking so slim and gorgeous, the dances are worth while watching. The cast includes Akshaye Khanna, Konkona Sen, Kunal Kapoor, Vinay Pathak, Divya Dutta and Irfan Khan.<br /><br />Madhuri Dixit\\'s charm is still there and this movie, for all her fans, is worth watching - this is the return of Madhuri.

Then you also should avoid this one, because it's so utterly bad that it's not even funny. The movie's plot circles around illegal, underground street-arena fights where the fighters use many kinds of brutal weapons and kill each other. Sound familiar? This has been done many times, but never as bad as this. Most of the fighters are really unfit and shabby people, and there aren't much that reminds me of true martial arts skills. The story makes no sense, and is just full of plot holes. I just don't get why Lorenzo Lamas stars in this.

              " b'The Planet is an interesting summary of today\\'s environmental problem, covering such topics as global warming, but also less well known topics (albeit still very important) such as resource exploitation and waste management.<br /><br />Unlike An Inconvenient Truth this movie is based on many interviews with various experts in the fields shown in the movie. Between the interviews we are shown interesting footage of the topic discussed, for example on resource exploitation you might see modern agriculture at work. The mood of the movie is also set by rather dramatic music, which clearly emphases that these issues are important and have to be taken seriously.<br /><br />The movie is not only about experts telling us about the situation today, but you also get to see \"normal\" people that have an opinion about the subjects in the movie, like the Chinese businessman and his take on resource exploitation as well as global warming or why not the workers from waste centers in Nigeria.<br /><br />All in all this movie covers many interesting topics in a dramatical way. This dramatical tone is also what drags the movie down somewhat, as it can be too intense and too much to swallow, particularly if the topic\\'s are new to you.

              " b'It\\'s fascinating to note how reviews of this film -- and many others -- seem to fall along political lines.<br /><br />Some who commented on this film and who liked it, happily saw a pro-UN message in Pollack\\'s effort. (Many of these appear to be non-Americans.) American have tended to judge the film for its story-telling qualities which are sadly lacking.) Unfortunately for Pollack, his masterpiece work \"Three Days of the Condor\" is a terribly hard act for anyone to follow, especially for its director who is competing with himself in this genre. \"The Interpreter\" does not fare well in this comparison.<br /><br />What was going on in this film? Sean Penn is a federal agent with an improbable and bizarre personal life (his dancer spouse is a runaway wife who dies in a car wreck with her lover...?) There there is all sorts of halting, non sequitur dialogue between Penn and Kidman that seems to hint at a romantic development but goes nowhere.<br /><br />The plot turns were all contrived and some of the action was incomprehensible -- why didn\\'t the agents get off the bus when told to? Why did they keep saying they didn\\'t want to expose their cover until they were blown to bits? It was one of many inexplicably odd plot devices that were counterintuitive. Much of this film was so contradictory it nearly gave me a headache.<br /><br />Movies are fiction, sleight of hand and fantasy but they have to be believable within their own context. \"Condor\" was brilliant in that it was believable within itself. Robert Redford was a thoroughly believable CIA analyst with a background that allowed him to elude assassination while developing a believable relationship with Faye Dunaway whom he kidnapped at random to aid his escape.<br /><br />I\\'ll simply fast-forward to the \"The Interpreter\\'s\" outrageously unrealistic ending which I will not reveal. I\\'ll simply ask viewers to compare it to the delicious twist at the end of \"Condor\" in which Redford is given fatherly advice by his own would-be assassin after the killer was instead ordered to murder the man who wanted Redford dead.<br /><br />\"Condor\" had a hard and realistic edge to it that is missing in \"Interpreter\".<br /><br />As for the political message of \"Interpreter\" regarding the UN, it seems one could see the film as arguing for and against the trouble-plagued international body. As a political message, Pollack\\'s film seems as confused as its plot.',\n",
              " b'I was a bit hesitant about renting out \"Red Dwarf\" the first time one of my friends recommended it too me but I got it out anyway because I always like finding a new fantastic show, and this was definitely all that and more. While in the early series having a tiny budget used on props and the sets it still managed to produce fantastic story lines and new characters every episode, it was when they got a bigger budget(Season 3 or 4 and over) that they really let their creative style loose going to different funny dimensions, meeting equally funny new character\\'s and with jokes about what different dimensions existed they still had great character jokes, which really made the humour of this show something to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The character\\'s in the show are a great example of how character interaction alone can make a show 100 times better, and in this we see such a wide range of character\\'s, lead and co starring that make this show great on its own even without all the other dimensions (This was, as I said earlier most of what the first 2 or 3 seasons were like). First there is Dave Lister, who is a slob but is also a deep down very caring and compassionate guy and to the writers credit, they really make it so that just when you think Dave is just a useless slob they write an episode which reveals more about that character and how he is really a good guy. Then there is Rimmer, and prude sort of fellow who has always wanted to become an officer but, not being able to, due to being a complete incompetent worker and a general nuisance to be around has convinced himself that he is a great worker, but has not been promoted due to being so good at what he does (Head Vending Machine Maitenence man). Anyway, as the series progresses he is one of the best walls to bounce jokes with between him and Lister, and while they are always fighting deep down they both don\\'t hate each other and Lister is actually quite understanding of the fact that Rimmer is a complete and utter Smeghead. After that there is Kryten, one of my favourite character\\'s in a TV show in the 20th centuries, from him trying to be more human to his pathetic whining he is another great wall of jokes with all the character\\'s. Last of the main character\\'s from the early seasons (Kochanski replacing Rimmer for a small time in season 7) is the obnoxious but oddly lovable Cat, who is a descendant from a cat Lister smuggled aboard (Which is the reason Dave was put into stasis and how he became the only human alive) who has now become a human looking and sounding up himself cat mutant who has an odd addiction to fashion. All these character\\'s make the show what it is and what it always will be.<br /><br />Overall the time has become a classic that will (Hopefully) live on forever bringing in new waves of followers.

Words cannot express how terrible this movie is. I don\\'t care how bad that J. Lo movie \"Gigli\" is, it will not hold a candle to this waste of matter for pure crappiness. Dolph Lundgren is a marine -(who apparently is the only member of the entire US armed forces who can fly a stealth fighter in footage lifted from another crappy Dolph movie)- that must go board a sub in Russia so that some chemical weapon that the Russians stole from the Americans during the cold war can come back to the US. On board is Dolph\\'s \"ex-fiance\", who aside from looking like a reject from a Ron Jeremy movie, is also possibly the worst actress to ever set foot on the planet. I had to look up this \"actress\" to see what other suckers have hired her for movies and found out two things.... 1. thankfully, she\\'s not \"in demand\" and 2. Her shoddy acting is eclipsed only by her amazing spelling; I think her name is \"Melanie\" but it looks like some sort of indecipherable mumbo jumbo the way it is spelled. Anyway, I\\'m off track... this movie is pure crap.. not even one of those \"watch with your friends after some herbal refreshment\" movies...

              " b'Couple the idea of New York as a maximum security prison with Kurt Russell\\'s hard-bitten performance as one-eyed outlaw Snake Plissken and you\\'ve got another one of John Carpenter\\'s contemporary classics. Nobody gets out of New York alive, it would seem; even the President of the United States... unless Plissken can haul his fat out of the fire. En route to the Chief Executive (\"President of what?\" Plissken asks at one point), there are downed planes and starving crazies who live in the sewers and old acquaintances hiding out in libraries and The Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes), whose army of ne\\'er do wells must be contended with. All within the allotted time: Plissken is literally a ticking time bomb, thanks to duplicitous Lee Van Cleef as the commander of the United States Police Force. For all its dark doings, however, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is also infused with an often subtle black humor that helps keep it from devolving into the kind of lackluster action film that features stars who can\\'t act; Russell as Plissken is also- surprise- vulnerable, and thence more real, than most action leads. One can\\'t help but sympathize with his character. (And one can\\'t help but think back to ELVIS, the amazing boob-tube biography directed by Carpenter with Russell in the lead: like ELVIS, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK delivers on an emotional level. One can\\'t ask for more than that.)',\n",

A bunch of high recognition celebrity voices are drafted for inane banter pasted over some stock footage of penguins wandering around the Antarctic, apparently seeking mates (or so we are told). Interspersed are some random shots of other animals touching themselves, again with sub-moronic observations by the voice-overs. Samuel L.

              " b\"There were three things I liked about this movie: Francis McDormand, Natasha McElhonne, and the music (which even at times was in the contrived hipster-vein). I've always argued that Christian Bale, while he chooses interesting projects and, on the whole, good movies, is not a very versatile actor. When you replace Willem Dafoe, Micheal Ironside, Emma Watson, and Micheal Caine with Kate Bekinsale, this shortcoming is apparent. Kate Bekinsale is ridiculous in this movie. I rarely see acting this awkward. The two of them combine to make the least interesting pair I've ever seen. Bekinsale's side story revolves around some ridiculous research of Drosophila. The unrealism comes in when the audience is supposed to believe that someone is writing their Ivy League thesis about the fruit fly. People do this type of thing in undergrad at LSU. A friend of mine told me that I simply don't understand the movie or the lifestyle it portrays because I'm not from LA. I can't buy into this because Mulholland Drive is easily my favorite movie. Lynch is able to convey to his audience the California-way with much more intelligence, and that's barely even a story.\",\n",
              " b'Few films have had as much nonsense written about them as Ernst Lubitsch\\'s \"Design For Living.\" From the moment it was released, it was criticized for rewriting Noel Coward\\'s then-daring play (Ben Hecht, the screenwriter, said: \"There\\'s only one line of Coward\\'s left in the picture--see if you can find it!\"); for casting Americans in parts that had originally been played by Coward, Alfred Lunt, and Lynn Fontanne; for toning down the gay subtexts of Coward\\'s play. All that is, of course, completely irrelevant; the question is not whether the play is faithful to the source material, but whether it\\'s good. And it is, it is.<br /><br />There are flaws in the film. This was one of the first times Lubitsch had made a movie with little or no music on the soundtrack; previously, in his musicals and his sublime \"Trouble In Paradise,\" he had used background music to cover up potential dead spots and carry the film along. Here there is none of that, with the result that some of the early scenes seem oddly paced. But the wit of the script (written by Hecht but, as always with Lubitsch, carefully supervised and contributed to by the director himself) and the appeal of the performers (more about them later) pull the film through the occasional rough spots, and the second half of the movie is just about perfect.<br /><br />Another idiotic thing that is often said about \"Design For Living\" is that Lubitsch and Hecht rewrote Coward due to fear of the censors. In fact, the censors must have had a heart attack when they saw \"Design,\" for this is one of the most sexually frank of the pre-Code Hollywood movies; premarital sex, cohabitation, adultery and frigidity are all clearly portrayed-- but, as always with Lubitsch, they are implied rather than shown. Lubitsch\\'s trademark door and blackout gags are here, and they are hilarious; again, it\\'s not Noel Coward--it\\'s Lubitsch, the cinema\\'s greatest comic filmmaker at the peak of his powers.<br /><br />But there\\'s something else here that isn\\'t found in most Lubitsch films, and it comes from Ben Hecht, whose cynical, fast-talking, very American style of writing gives the characters a flavor quite unlike the more Continental wit of Lubitsch\\'s usual heroes. (This is also one of the few Lubitsch films where the lead characters are American rather than European.) Critics have sometimes complained that Hecht\\'s somewhat inelegant style was unworthy of either Coward or Lubitsch. Again, I disagree; the moments of Hechtian farce (like the hilarious party scene) are beautifully handled by Lubitsch and turn the film into a forerunner of screwball comedy, the place where Continental charm and hard-driving Americanism meet.<br /><br />Now to the actors. The \"British is Better\" attitude of many critics made it inevitable that Lubitsch\\'s American cast would be pilloried. Again, this is not Noel Coward and a Noel Coward style of acting wouldn\\'t work in this context. All the leading players are actually quite wonderful: Miriam Hopkins, one of Lubitsch\\'s favorite actresses, has the best role and gives a marvelously energetic performance as the flighty, pretentious free spirit who tries to substitute art for sex; Gary Cooper is at the height of his youthful charm, with a surprisingly light comic touch and great teamwork with Fredric March. March, who can often be heavy-handed in film comedy, is here charming and funny; it\\'s a tribute to Lubitsch that he got such a genial performance out of him. And, of course, there\\'s Edward Everett Horton, one of Hollywood\\'s finest character actors in one of his finest roles.<br /><br />If you know and love the Noel Coward play, don\\'t expect this movie to be a faithful adaptation. Think of it as an original work of comedic art that happens to utilize some of the story elements of Coward\\'s play. It\\'s not Noel Coward; it\\'s a splendid romantic farce that, like all great comedies, has serious themes underneath the fun: Sexual freedom, male vs. female roles in society, art, love, friendship. So see it (if you can; it\\'s not on video, alas). It\\'s not Noel Coward, it\\'s Ernst Lubitsch, and despite the occasional flaws, it\\'s Lubitsch at his best.',\n",

The wigs didn\\'t bother me at all actually. Overall I thought the whole production seemed quite serious and it looked good to me and didnt detract from the movie.<br /><br />The thing that puts this movie down is the script and directing. It\\'s absolutely terrible. And I\\'m not kidding here. It seems like something I wrote back in fourth grade. And the way they try to put humour into it. It\\'s pretty hilarious, not due to the jokes, but due to it being so utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />And it\\'s not particularly true to that age either. I mean people didn\\'t call the plague \"the plague\" back then. They called it the \"big death\". Also they had no idea that the rats were the ones spreading the disease either so there\\'s no reason for the characters of the movie to fear the rats so much.<br /><br />I dont really know what this movie wants. It seems like half of the time they\\'re trying to have a history lesson and the other they\\'re trying to be funny. And inbetween they\\'re just riding on horses. There\\'s no red line connecting it at all. I\\'ll admit it gave me a few laughs but that was mostly due to the horses having so short legs making them look ridiculous when they galloped.

              " b'This film has caught me off guard a few times. At first I thought Samir Horn(Don Cheadle) was trying to infiltrate the terrorist organization who are suicide bombers that believes in something like the Qur\\'an by earning there trust, but later it seemed that he was actually loyal to the terrorist organization or even a double agent. And thought it would show the film in the terrorist point of view from the main character, which probably wouldn\\'t have sit right with most Americans. But later it is revealed that he does work for a organization that is trying to take down the terrorist group leader Nathir and get a hold of the terrorist plans. Even while playing this guessing game, I didn\\'t feel cheated because it was well crafted and gave some clues. I found the whole premise of Samir going to prison in order to befriend Omar who is a member of the terrorist organization a bit over the top, but there is way more over the top stuff that happens in these types of genres. I found the joke about how the suicide bombers are on a mission to get laid with 72 virgins pretty funny. Since it is pretty much the truth, but the film shows that not every people that believe in Allah are bad people and even the revealing of Samir\\'s past shows this, who is also a firm believer in Allah. In fact I didn\\'t necessarily hate Samir or Omar, even if Omar is a real terrorist for some reason. Maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous, although being courageous isn\\'t necessarily a good thing. So basically agent Roy Clayton investigates a dangerous international conspiracy responsible for a prison break in Yemen, a bombing in Nice and a raid in London. And all clues seem to lead back to a former U.S Special Operations officer, Samir horn. But soon contradictory evidence emerges, forcing Clayton to question whether his suspect is a disaffected former military operative or something more complicated, like the movies tagline. I was expecting some flashy fast paced spy movie but it turned out different from what I expected in that, it has some good drama to go with the action in fact the film has more drama than action. The first hour of \"Traitor\" was simply great, but after the first hour it started to lose it\\'s entertainment value and became a bit tedious. The parts after the first hour wasn\\'t bad, but just wasn\\'t good as the first hour of the film which kept me guessing. After the first hour, things start to get predictable, not that I knew what the ending was going to be or Samir\\'s last plan, but I knew what direction it is going. The stupid character decisions that jeopardize the mission got a bit irritating as well, it just seemed illogical and irrational. It was a decent espionage thriller with few glitches to sum it up.<br /><br />7.4/10',\n",
              " b'\"Unhinged\" is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It\\'s hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. It\\'s plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins. <br /><br />As far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. NONE of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the \"lead\" girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven\\'t seen before. However, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. It comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic \"Sleepaway Camp.\" Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act. It may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end, but I say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes. 4 out 10',\n",

Definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out (in my DVD copy anyway). Don't attempt to understand it, just go along and watch out for the weird bits...which is everything. Don't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense.

From the onset the movie was pretty tame and I felt the set up was a bit long, I was praying for the carnage to just start already. However once it did, the movie found some very funny moments. The main characters weren't all that compelling but the two comic relief friends Diggs (Tadhg Murphy) and Henry (Laurence Kinlan) did manage to get a few good lines in. The movie had its share of plot holes (quite a few of these were pretty big.) <br /><br />But on the whole I did find it funny and I was smiling by the end so it wasn't too bad, just nothing to write home about. I felt it tried a little too hard to fit with what are usually American high school stereotypes and could have been a little more homegrown. The over the top gore (which was my whole reason for viewing) was good but the movie ended very quickly and after such a long set up I was a little disappointed.

              " b\"My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece.<br /><br />Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again.<br /><br />The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.<br /><br />The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.<br /><br />The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.<br /><br />If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.<br /><br />Never the less, I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest Reguards.<br /><br />10/10\",\n",
              " b'Based on the trailers, I was dreading seeing this film, as it looked like a shallow dull romantic movie with a \"clever\" twist in the form of the time traveller. However, I was very pleased to find, within ten minutes of the film starting, that it was clear that I was wrong; it was a very complex movie, looking at various problems/blessings that the main character\\'s condition meant. The first part of the film obviously introduced the titular character, his condition, and the love interest. This was done very cleverly, as she had known him for many years, but it was the first time he had met her. This is because it was an older version of him that travelled back to her childhood and earlier years. This broken timeline continues throughout the whole film, meaning that it could have easily been an incoherent muddle, but the director has controlled things carefully; sometimes following the traveller\\'s timeline, so everyone around him changes age suddenly; sometimes following everyone else\\'s timeline, so the traveller appears to suddenly age/become younger. The plot was kept on a low level; no one has to save the world in this film; it\\'s just about a couple trying to live a normal life given the bizarre condition the husband has. The time travelling is played to various effects throughout the story; there are a few scenes of comedy, some extremely touching emotional scenes, and some genuine shocks. good few plot twists come as a surprise, at times drastically changing the tone of the movie, but never coming across as contrived. While there is little to no action to keep you entertained, the characters are certainly interesting enough to keep you in this movie, with the entire cast playing their parts perfectly; most importantly, everyone acts realistically, no over-blown dramatic reactions. The people I saw this with have read the book, and some changed were made to the plot, but based on what I was told, the film\\'s interpretation of the plot is far better; certain events omitted did not belong in the story in my opinion, and cutting them out made the lasting impression of the film far less depressing. 9/10.',\n",

Henry Wilcoxson, his Marc Anthony of Cleopatra and the always beautiful Loretta Young team up in this extravagant epic. King Richard the Lionheart is not a Christian and is not faithful to the ways of the sign of the cross but to escape a forced marriage he signs up for the Crusades to free the holy city of Jerusalem. Of course, there is scheming behind his back to seize his throne while he is gone. Along the way he trades for a wife, Loretta and haggles and argues with his other European leaders. Now, it has often not be said for it is almost as if De Mille build big sets and big stories to tell little moments for all his excess, his movies are ridiculously dialogue driven, even by the standards of the other expensive blockbuster-type movies made back then. De Mille loved dialogue scenes and focusing on character. Very strange. And this movie is really a politics and character movie as the future of Europe is argued and royal pompous exposed. The action sequences are obvious studio sets but well shot. The final moments have good heart that is not forced but earned. Thus, is this a good movie. It is hard to say because for every good scene there is a juvenile scene obviously put in to satiate the masses. Good direction though, very good direction.

              " b\"With Mission Impossible like precision, Sean Connery, Lesley Anne Down, and Donald Sutherland pull off The First Great Train Robbery, years before Jesse James did it in the American West. <br /><br />Of course holding up a train with a dozen masked bandit confederates doesn't equal the near precision complexity that it took to steal gold bullion off a train by three men in stealth. Connery is the mastermind of the scheme and he plays Edward Pierce with the usual charm we've come to associate with Connery. <br /><br />It was interesting how Connery gets the idea for the heist in your typical Englishman's club with at least one of the responsible parties for the gold in that very room. The other club members know him as a retired industrialist who seems rather well fixed and comfortable. If they only knew the real source of his comfort.<br /><br />Lesley Anne Down may have given her career performance here as Connery's girl friend. Their scenes fairly crackle with witty repartee and sexual innuendo. Down is certainly not above using her sex to help in the robbery. In fact the first part of the plan which took about a year in preparation was to get duplicates of four keys that unlock the safe on the train where the bullion is transported. She compromises one of the key custodians in a Victorian bordello which is the film's humor highlight.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland is the safecracker friend of Connery's enlisted for the caper. He gets the dirtiest details of the caper. In fact the authorities get wind of some kind of plan in the works and Connery has to make some last minute adjustments to his plan. The adjustments call for Sutherland to get into the car in a coffin with a dead cat for odorous effect. What some won't do for money. Sutherland handles the whole thing quite well.<br /><br />Connery has the dangerous part of the caper which calls for him to go from front to back on a moving train. Those sequences according to the Films of Sean Connery were shot in Ireland which better represented the look of rural 1855 England. I was stunned to learn that Connery himself did the stunts. Sean admitted himself that it was the most dangerous business he ever undertook for any film. What some will do for the sake of art.<br /><br />The First Great Train Robbery is a stylish caper film set in Victorian Great Britain and the film really captures the look and manner of the period. One of Sean Connery's best films, definitely worth a look.\",\n",
              " b\"From what little I've watched of Ferrara's work up till now - 6 films including the one under review - this emerges as easily the most substantial (I liked his BODY SNATCHERS [1993] but have always deemed it an unnecessary update).<br /><br />It's generally compelling and filled with typically intense performances - Christopher Walken and Annabella Sciorra from Ferrara's THE ADDICTION (1995), Chris Penn, Vincent Gallo and Benicio Del Toro (though some of the over-the-top histrionics, usually involving Penn's bad-tempered character, do raise the occasional unintended chuckle). The plot, adopting a flashback structure which leads up to the titular occasion, deals with the director's favorite themes - honor, faith, violence - and, as such draws parallels with the gangster films of Coppola, Scorsese and even Tarantino.<br /><br />On the strength of this, I rented two more Ferrara titles - FEAR CITY (1984) and KING OF NEW YORK (1990; again, with Walken) - to go along with BAD LIEUTENANT (1992; which I just recorded off late-night Italian TV, where it was presented in the original language); the latter two, in particular, are films that I've been meaning to check out for years (I just hope it'll be worth it).<br /><br />By the way, though I rented THE FUNERAL from my local DVD outlet as part of a 2-Disc Set with THE ADDICTION, I was actually the one to have brought it over to him from London!\",\n",
              " b\"Super Dimensional Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? Ah, what a name and what a movie. This is what classic Japanese Animation is all about. Just the name itself conjures up nostalgic memories of yesterday, running home from fourth grade to catch the latest episode of Robotech, to attending my first Anime convention and realizing the true power of the unedited series as well as this incredible film which retells the story. The music, the characters, the animation and the story are the very things that attracted me to Japanese animation in the first place. And still, even after all of these years, SDFM:DYRL not only holds up, but is still a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />This is due, in no small part, to the creative talent and storytelling capabilities of Shoji Kawamori. Although his filmography may be small, it is an example of quality over quantity. Kawamori's Macross series made giant transforming robots, singing pop-idol young starlets, heroic floppy haired boys, and melodramatic drama popular to thousands of fans across the globe. Who in their right mind never dreamed of someday flying a Valkyrie, or meeting a girl as spunky and hot as Lynn Minmay or as gorgeous and smart as Misa Hayase? Or who never wished that their hair were as cool as Max's blue locks or Hikaru's tangled mop? And who never wished for the experiences and friendships shared by the Defense Force as they battled the onslaught of the Zentradi forces? Without Kawamori, none of these questions would have ever even been possible. To me, this is like trying to imagine a childhood without Star Wars.<br /><br />SDFM:DYRL is at it's core, a story of an alien invasion. The Zentradi, a race of aliens created for only war are hell-bent on tracking down a lost ship, the Macross, which is the key to the universal power of Protoculture. Protoculture is the universal matter from which all things were created and it gives life to those who have it. The Zentradi track down this lost ship, which has landed on Earth. The humans of Earth learn, to a somewhat limited degree, the power of the Macross, and are able to escape with a few hundred survivors to the outer reaches of space, thus setting in motion the constant game of cat and mouse between the Zentradi and the humans. Although this story is quite basic on the surface, what really set Macross apart from the other giant-invading-robot movies/series was the investment the audience had in the characters.<br /><br />The animation itself is quite beautiful, although it may seem somewhat primitive by today's digital standards. It is, however, a great example of how Japanese animation differs from its Western counterparts. While Western animation, especially concerning studios such as Disney and Warner Bros., put more energy into creating smooth animated movement, the Japanese directors and artists have always been more interested in creating insanely detailed drawings. Some Japanese directors have claimed that Japanese animation is actually more of a mix between the detailed still drawings of manga and the fluidity of traditional Western animation, thus it is an art form in and of itself being neither comic book nor cartoon. Macross is a perfect example of this ideology. Although the animation may not be extremely fluid, what we are given are vastly detailed cityscapes, landscapes and space frontiers, as well as mechanical and character designs to die for.<br /><br />And how can I possibly even mention the word Macross without at least a brief mention of the music? Kentaro Haneda, who created the original music, made sure that the score and songs were as captivating as the film itself, as well as making sure every note of every song fit perfectly with what was being shown on screen. After all, with music playing such an intricate roll in the entire Macross saga, the music really needed to be top notch \\xc2\\x96 and it was.<br /><br />SDFM:DYRL is a classic in every sense of the word. A movie that is just as good today as it was almost 20 years ago. Some films do not live up to the memories we have of them, and as we get older some films lose their power. SDFM:DYRL on the other hand, becomes a beacon of light to remind us of the reasons we fell in love with Japanese films in the first place.\",\n",

A lot of the dialog was interesting,seemed to be a lot of ad libbing. What the heck was Lori Singer doing in the movie? Neve\\'s character meets her in the park and says \"Hi Lori\" and they talk a few minutes about movies. Mike Tyson also makes an appearance as himself and seems to have some acting talent. The film starts and ends with Neve Campbell in a shower. The rest is a waste of eyes and ears. I usually agree with Roger Ebert,but he was one of the very few critics that liked the film. He gave it a top rating. Maybe he loves Neve more than me.',\n",
              " b'\"Batalla en el cielo\" is one of those inert, enervating art movies that comes along from time to time and has highbrow critics reaching for the superlatives. By using amateur actors it masquerades as naturalistic, but it is in fact as artificial as a piece of modern conceptual art.<br /><br />**Major spoilers ahead** <br /><br />Set in present day Mexico City, what little story there is revolves around a chubby middle-aged chauffeur named Marcos (Marcos Hernandez), who together with his even chubbier wife, seems to have kidnapped a baby who has subsequently died. All this drama happens off camera, as does just about everything else that might be of interest, except for the sex. Indeed, Marcos has quite a lot of sex, both with his wife and (separately) with a much younger woman named Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), the daughter of his rich employer. Marcos, who may or may not be guilt-ridden about the infant\\'s death (it\\'s anybody\\'s guess, since all the actors have clearly been directed to refrain from anything resembling emotional expression), tells Ana about the kidnapping and she encourages him to turn himself in to the police. Later on he stabs Ana to death and then joins a religious pilgrimage, dying on his knees in church. As has been well documented, the sex in \"Batalla en el cielo\" is very explicit indeed. Director Carlos Reygadas seems to be garnering praise for the mere fact that he has filmed overweight and not very attractive people naked and having sex. But really, so what? It\\'s been interpreted as some kind of laudable corrective to the cosmetic eroticism that Hollywood and the porn industry peddles. It isn\\'t, of course, for the simple reason that the movie overall isn\\'t remotely good enough to mediate the intended visceral impact of lengthy depictions of actual sex. In the context of the story the extended and graphic nature of these scenes is simply as unwarranted as it would have been if the actors were beautiful and glamorous. Admittedly the sexual imagery does provide momentary glimpses of the raw and vulnerable humanity of these people, and had it featured in a more emotionally rounded and professionally told story it might have carried a much greater resonance. As it is, just about everything that happens feels meaningless and remote, because Reygadas evidently has no interest in supplying his audience with any interpretive hooks, and unsurprisingly none of the amateur actors is skilled enough to fully inhabit on screen the bodies that they have so boldly put on display.',\n",
              " b'This movie is just bad beyond belief. The acting is horrid, while the cast is simply reciting lines with little feeling. I do wonder where they got these people. The actors just chop up the dialog like a salad. The television idea is just that, with no real sense of development in a hopeless, lifeless plot. The lack of a music track in 1935 is not uncommon, but some sort of musical score was really needed in a suspense movie of this type. I had wanted to see his movie for years. Now I can honestly say I am sorry did. As many a horror movie philosopher has said, somewhere in the middle of an endlessly dark night, \"There are some things that are best left alone.\" This movie, sadly, is one of them. May it rest in peace.',\n",

That this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough, but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories.<br /><br />I found this movie average at best. Art direction could have been much better, as could have been cinematography. The acting was good, and so was Eva van der Gucht's singing.\",\n",
              " b'This is a movie called \" The Mean Season \" and stars one of the best action actors of today\\'s cinema. Kurt Russell is Malcolm Anderson a Miami reporter working for a Florida newspaper called the Journal. He is suppose to be an experienced hard hitting journalist who\\'s immediate future is to retire his position, get married and move to a small town and settle down. His girlfriend\\'s idea, not his. Unfortunately, a serial killer appears and calls him with the shocking details of a recent murder. Thereafter he is hooked into covering the macabre story for national coverage and that does not sit well with his girlfriend Christine (mariel Hemingway) who is stunning in her role. Richard Jordan is Alan Delour a mad killer out to prove he is not mad at all, but desires some half witted attention from the reading public. Andy Garcia in his debut appearance is Ray Martinez, a police detective. William Smith is Albert O\\'Shaughnessy, a veteran counselor and is surprisingly good in the small role. But it is Russell who despite his best with his character is less than convincing. The story line is clear cut and chasing Jordon proves elusive. For Russell fans, there is much to be desired and waiting for the finale is disappointing. Still, I like to see Kurt Russell and so the film is sadly relegated to his second string. ****',\n",
              " b'Although not quite as good as it\\'s sequel, \"Emmanuelle: Joys of A Woman,\" this film made Dutch actress/model Sylvia Kristel an international star, and changed the way sex was presented in mainstream film forever after. Filmed in exotic Thailand, this is the engaging story of a beautiful young woman\\'s sexual awakening, (or sexual corruption, depending on how you look at it.) Emmanuelle is the 19 year old wife of a wealthy diplomat, a man older than her, and with much more worldly experience than his innocent young bride. Jean is proud to claim that Emmanuelle is not his possession, and that he would like nothing more than for her to be free to explore her own sexuality. However when Emmanuelle falls in love and runs off with a female friend, her husband doesn\\'t deal with it as well as he thought. Emmanuelle, played by the exquisite Sylvia Kristel, is surrounded by people eager to teach her all about eroticism and sensuality. There are the bored, jet set wives who spend their days lounging by the pool in tiny swimsuits and gigantic 70\\'s sunglasses. There is the young girl, Marie-Ange, forever sucking lolli-pops, who teaches Emmanuelle not to be ashamed of masturbation, (in a very hot scene,). There is the bitchy Arianne, forever trying to seduce the younger Emmanuelle. And finally there is the older man, Mario, who is the catalyst, the man who \"breaks\" Emmanuelle, through a series of sometimes disturbing sexual games, re-inventing her into the sexually liberated woman that we see in the numerous sequels. And for those only familiar with the sequels, this is an important one to see, as this is where Emmanuelle comes into being. It is quite fascinating to watch this character develop from a wide eyed innocent, into a free-thinking sexual being, a woman not afraid to enjoy what men have enjoyed since the dawn of time. The erotic scenes are tasteful, and never go beyond soft-core. \"Emmanuelle\" is an erotic film with a lot of class and style. There is a particular scene which has been cut from many new DVD releases; a violent rape scene in an opium den. The scene is important, as it is a pivotal scene in Emmanuelle\\'s \"education.\" It is the scene that breaks her, and makes her realize that sex is not something to be feared. In the scene directly following that rape, she is brought to a Thai boxing match, where her body is the prize for the winning fighter. This sexual encounter could have been a rape also, but because she is not afraid, there is no rape, just a consensual act that she derives great pleasure from. Classic 70\\'s theme, more controversial today than it was then. This is a must for fans of cult and erotic films. And if you enjoy this, seek out \"Emmanuelle 2;\" it\\'s even better!',\n",
              " b\"Marco Tullio Giordana deserves praise for bringing this saga about two brothers in Italy that spans a few decades and paints a picture about the country. Mr. Giordana and the writers of this series made for television, Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, painted a rich canvas of modern Italy as events of the last forty years surface in this gripping tale of two brothers and the people whose lives they touched.<br /><br />It's impossible to summarize the events we see in the film. After all, it's running time and all the things that happen are too numerous to mention. Suffice it to say, the story never loses the viewer's interest as proved when we recently watched the two part DVD. We had no idea what we were getting into, but almost by magic, Mr. Giordana and his collaborators took us to a wonderful trip.<br /><br />Best of all are the great characterizations Mr. Giordana was able to get from the two leads: Luigi LoCoscio and Alessi Boni, who play Nicola and Matteo Carali. Some excellent ensemble playing was also achieved by the large cast in this series.<br /><br />The inspired cinematography by Foberto Forza does wonders to enhance all we see. The score include music by Bach, Mozart and even Piazzolla. This is a triumph indeed for the director Mr. Giordana and all the people who contributed to make this a most unusual and poignant portrait of a people and a culture.\",\n",
              " b'ASTRO BOY is a full-length CGI animated American adaptation of the massively-popular Japanese manga (comic book) and television series fictional character of the same name ASTRO BOY, created by Ozamu Tezuka, who is considered as \"the God of Manga\". Its manga series was first published in 1952 and its television program first broadcast in Japan in 1963.<br /><br />Basically the storyline of Astro Boy is a sort of futuristic version of Pinocchio, but is extended by story lines of action, adventure, and pure sci-fi. Astro Boy is a robot boy, who initially has gone through an identity crisis, but later on, serves as more of a superhero who gets into various adventures and is consistently bent on promoting peace in his society wherein robots live side-by-side human beings.<br /><br />Arguably, Astro Boy is the quintessential children\\'s action hero because he is an ideal mix of pure innocence, a loving heart, and an explosive little dynamite when the going gets tough. Although he shoots lasers, and has weapon turrets from his butt, he is always doing his best to resolve things with a more friendlier approach, and always has that cute optimism that even the darkest of villains may possibly be persuaded do good things instead.<br /><br />This recent Astro Boy movie is indeed, in my opinion, a good way of reintroducing Astro Boy to a younger generation. Spectacular and fun-filled, the movie is never a waste of time. The eye candy aspect is high; it almost reaches the level of Pixar quality. The action is moderately impressive, on the other hand, it has the best \"I can fly\" sequence (I\\'m talking about that sequence when the main character discovers he can fly or do superhuman things and goes out in a self-indulging fun trip) and is superior in comparison to those in movies like Spider-man, Superman and Iron Man. It may be just animation but when Astro Boy is having fun in the sky, his joy radiates unto the audience.<br /><br />Although this is not all comedy from start to finish, the humor was enough to make the movie enjoyable. There are only a few punchlines placed here and there, but no matter how few they are, they pack a punch of solid laughter. I was really amused at the three robots that referred to themselves as the Robot Liberation Front. They were probably my favorite characters in this entire movie. From their quirkily hilarious character designs up to the overall portrayal of these robots, they easily got me tickled pink.<br /><br />While voice actors Freddie Highmore as Astro Boy and the rest of the voice cast such as Kristen Bell, Bill Nighy, Donald Sutherland, Nathan Lane, and Eugene Levy were all generically good, it was Nicholas Cage, voicing Dr. Tenma, Astro boy\\'s father, whose voice acting complemented excellently with the animation. It was as if it captured Cage in one of his best acting moments. It would not have been easy to bring the character of Tenma to a full-length movie version without altering it. In the original manga (Japanese comics) version and in the TV series, Tenma is portrayed as more brutal and has certainly a darker character, as he deliberately abandons and sells Astro boy, and in one other interpretation, he goes insane. The Tenma portrayed in this new movie version is a more positive version, as he is still bound by love for his creation, Astro Boy. Inevitably and obviously you expect this Tenma to do the morally upright thing.<br /><br />The storyline aspect was pretty solid. Simplistic to be family-friendly, yet it has some plot and characterization elements that appeal to adults as well. It ends up as a movie that is both young at heart yet mature in content. Enjoyable for kids, interesting for adults. The story does not treat its audiences like idiots, and manages to tell the story without applying unnecessary restraint that can hinder a writer\\'s creativity. In addition, the writers and the rest of the crew have an enormous pressure to make this project become perfect. That is because Astro Boy is like a national figure in Japan, as much as how Mickey Mouse is towards Americans. And in my opinion, the Americans did deliver a good script for him.<br /><br />Inevitably, the movie keeps itself faithful with the source material on Astro Boy\\'s origins but there are indeed many little alterations made in order to update this Astro Boy as being this generation\\'s version. Rife with enough heart, humor, and spectacular explosive action, this movie has a storyline that easily pleases its audience. It is indeed worth your time & your money if you are looking for a family-friendly movie this week.',\n",
              " b'This film is much better than the ratings its been getting from others. I\\'ve watched many other thrillers over the years, most with larger budgets, and would place this one somewhere in the middle of the pack. Blackport gives a decent acting performance, though not of the caliber of other great \"thriller\" actresses such as Jodie Foster and Laura Linney, and yet the movie was quite compelling and intense. Sure, the story plot was simple, and some of the cast came across a bit stilted, but nevertheless it held my rapt attention for its entire length. I look forward to the next sequel in the 3-part trilogy about Anna Carter. Given her medical condition and her plan, it makes for a fascinating story.',\n",

If you liked it I highly recommend the other broken arrow film called \"The Sum of All Fears\". \"Broken Arrow\" is incredibly underrated and should be classified as T2.

Many situations were predictable for me, I knew he would get busted on the rooftop as he was about to kiss the girl and I knew he would get held up right after he said he was 50 feet from the police station. At times I was having more of a time picking out who I recognized from other films....the wanna-be pimp was the gas station attendant from Dusk Till Dawn, the drunk at the bar was the head of the jail from Bad Boys (Sean Penn flick, NOT the Martin Lawrence one with the STOLEN name), the bartender is a bit player in many films. This movie reminded me somewhat of Blind Date with Bruce Willis in that everything was going wrong on his night out too and he also ended up getting busted.',\n",

(OK, if not the 'human side', at least you get to see what it's like on the inside.) From a cultural perspective, a 1980s Tokyo is also interesting, with shots of the cityscape, pachinko parlors, love hotels, etc.<br /><br />One last comment: There is nudity in this film, but It adds to the story of the film, justifying why some of the characters do what they do.\",\n",

If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life?

Dix's performance is generally pretty good. But, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. Also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />This is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role.\",\n",

Problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds. The video store shelves are filled with these so called films. These aren't even guilty pleasures, they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making trash cinema, but most of their films are b movie gold. However, some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some, like 'Nightmare Weekend,' didn't deserve any form of release at all. <br /><br />Pros: The cast members do the best they can with the lousy material. Some unintentional hilarity. Moves at a good pace (Should at 81 minutes).<br /><br />Cons: Awful writing, which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes. Poorly lit, especially the night scenes and the ending, which you can't make out at all. Doesn't make a lick of sense. Badly scored. Cheap and very dated effects. Total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody. This is supposed to be a horror film, but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I never expected this to be some forgotten gem, but I never imagined it would be this bad. I don't know if it's the worst film ever made, but it's a definite contender. Troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release.

              " b\"The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera couldn't hold still because they were having a seizure or something. There is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie. There is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and doesn't stop until the credits roll. I also didn't like when all her friends were being shot (or not I don't know)and she goes in the van and puts band aids on. That was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie. How much gas can a person siphon to get a van going? It must be a whole lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie. It was a terrible movie and I would highly suggest not ever seeing it in your whole entire life.\",\n",
              " b'I\\'m not a John Cleese completist (although I thought \"Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I am a fan, and when I saw this sitting, neglected, on a shelf at my local Blockbuster, I decided to give it a try. What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences I\\'ve ever had. The writing is typical English \"goon show\" schtick. In fact, as an audio skit, this wouldn\\'t be out of place on a \"Firesign Theater\" album. But the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates \"Strange Case\" into the kind of jaw-dropping performance that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics. <br /><br />The Brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed \"tics\" of character and timing, and the creators use both to good effect here. Cleese\\'s portrayal of \"Holmes\" seems to owe much to the Arkin\\'s and Seller\\'s \"Inspector Clouseau\"; however Cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own. But the unexpected treat here is Arthur Lowe, who plays \"Watson\" as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film. I\\'d never heard of Lowe before this (his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I\\'m concerned.<br /><br />Some people might not care for \"Strange Case...\", especially if British whimsy isn\\'t their \"cuppa tea\". But I am extremely glad I got to see this before it vanished from sight.',\n",
              " b\"I am going to give the reader until the end of this short critique to figure out how the bugs were killed. Because with all of these so called scientist, experts working on how to kill them you would think the solution would be harder then taking a trip to your local Home Depot. This movie is so bad it was good. First thing I didn't get the time-line. The man who dastardly invented these mutant bugs seems to also have picked up the use of super warp speed traveling while working in the lab late at night. One minute he is in Virginia and the next minute he is in Pittsburgh. Same goes for the scientist couple. One minute they are living together the next scene they are separated and she is pregnant. And there was no indication that this was 2 months later..it was like the next day. They are married but for some reason they seem to keep their marriage a secret. Why I do not know. They work for two different agencies. Then we have her father thrown into the mix. Who just happens to be a farmer in the Midwest straight in the path of the Bugs. We see Lucy Loveless who plays the lead seemingly drive to Indiana with the redeemed dastardly scientist ( who BTW daughter was attacked by locust and is now in a coma)from the DC area in warp speed time to warn her father who I guess does not have a radio or TV but has have a super sleek cell phone that the bugs are coming straight for him! Meantime we have the real villain..no not the bugs, not the dastardly scientist but a angry 4 star General who seems a little too eager to gas people with the same poison used by Sadaam Hussian (as were are reminded) to kill the bugs. We see a scene with what looked like a herd of sheep but I think it is cattle since we later find out they were eaten by the locust. They are now carnivorous! This is getting better then that classic movie Frogs. Most of the movie is spent watching scenes of locust swarming down on crowds..causing mayhem at a airport but no one is killed by locust eating them. Except one person toward the end after we find out that they like to eat flesh.but no other reports of death by Locust. And he looks like he was attacked by Slugs. The rest of the movie is spent in a battle of the wills between the Maniacal General and the husband and wife scientist trying to find a way to kill the bugs without killing folks. We have the usual war room scenes too. OK OK time is up for the solution. Seems like the good old Bug Zapper was the solution. This they figure out while bugs get zapped while trying to get into a silo! Yes one giant bug zapper. One had to think that during a day in the backyard having a barbecue someone would of noticed what those things hanging up off a tree limb was there for. Considering every time any bug got near it meant certain death. Kind of like seeing this movie.\",\n",

I\\'m sure if I owned this DVD I\\'d always wish to skip by the poorer stuff.<br /><br />I really liked Donny Osmond, Elaine Page, Michael Ball and the various \"Cats\" songs and the song by Boy Zone.<br /><br />I was greatly irritated that they let Antonio Banderas sing the Phantom. He just does not have the voice for Phantom of the Opera. His Evita song was OK though.<br /><br />There were also a couple of songs by people that I did not recognize that had very bad unmusical voices.<br /><br />Sarah Brightman\\'s voice is good but her facial expressions looked a bit odd.<br /><br />DVD lovers will find the Dolby 5.1 track on the DVD sounds very flat. It feels more like Dolby 2.0 or even Dolby mono at times.<br /><br />So overall I\\'d give it 7/10. Since the best parts can be found on Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and on Cats (both of which I own already) I don\\'t feel compelled to buy this DVD. It is worth watching. However, I\\'d only recommend buying it if you don\\'t have any of the other Andrew Lloyd Weber DVDs.',\n",

So, I already expected it to have a lacking storyline, but at least this time it won\\'t be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.<br /><br />This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen (I\\'m being nice - no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said). Not only was the storyline non-existent, but the action was crap too. I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win. And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his \"girls\" (an Imus comment would work in this case) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I couldn\\'t take it anymore. So, I only got to see half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I had ever walked out on. Afterwards, I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. You\\'re better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home. I will keep all viewers in my prayers.',\n",

The tone is like a humorous piece from The New Yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the \"Goings On About Town\" page of that magazine. The only thing odd is the casting. Made a few years later William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you wouldn\\'t have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in some shear and slinky outfits, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio. Even if you know nothing about bridge, you may still want to check out a rare example of Hollywood satire.',\n",

And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. A couple of unexplained scenes towards the end. Watch it when you have the time.

I\\'ve never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.<br /><br />Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. So, her voice has very little inflection. I can\\'t believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to know somebody in the biz.<br /><br />Now I hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be \"this\" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.<br /><br />However, I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was disappointing as well. Maybe if her acting had been better, I would have liked it.',\n",

The story was intriguing enough with little twists and turns. The chemistry between the three main characters (played by Patricia Clarkson, Peter Sarsgaard and Campbell Scott) was wonderful. These are all fine actors and they definitely showcased their acting abilities in this film. Peter Sarsgaard was presented a special acting award by the SIFF organization before this screening and looking back at some of his previous works, I think this was well-deserved. The story might leave some unanswered questions but that's the beauty of endings that leave you asking some questions.\",\n",

The scenery is BEAUTIFUL, especially good for a cold winter night's viewing by a fireplace. I thought the subtle differences in what was acceptable in the 30s and today was quite remarkable too. Especially when Cooper sat on the end of the bed during his conversation (which was by itself quite the fuss back than)with the girl. Overall the story also gives an interesting review of immigration and the nation's feelings about it. Hard work was certainly central to the movie's theme and of course the end is tragic as the guy doesn't get the girl.\",\n",

The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70\\'s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer\\'s \"The Quatermass Xperiment\" ...only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting dude\\'s face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs\\' screenplay doesn\\'t waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you\\'ll miss out on all the campy fun!',\n",

When Miss Julie began I thought to myself, \"Thank goodness the WHOLE movie couldn\\'t possibly be THIS boring. If it were, I\\'d be very angry at the loss of three bucks it took to rent it!\" An hour and a half later, I was indeed irate at the loss of my three bucks; I could have put better use to the money by plunking twelve quarters into an arcade machine or a stuffed animal crane. At least if I had wasted that money on the crane I might have taken away something warm and fuzzy with me. There is NOTHING warm and fuzzy about this movie. Mind you, a movie doesn\\'t have to be happy to be good, but in the world of movies worth watching it DOES have to be entertaining! Entertainment is the LAST word you can use to describe this movie! I have been greatly entertained by Miss Burrows in the past. I cannot say this was one of those times. Her acting was passable at most. She seemed to be high on marijuana, not drunk on homemade hooch. Mr. Mullan was melodramatic in his role of an ambitious footman, and to make him the \"romantic\" lead in the process was just hysterical! A serious bit of miscasting took place when they filled the role of Jean. He was too enthusiastic in areas where he should have been subdued and he was FAR TOO SUBDUED in areas where he should have shown fire and passion. I know the script is horrible, but if you\\'re going to commit to a bad screenplay, commit to it! I\\'d comment on the other characters, especially the role of Christine (played by Maria Doyle Kennedy) but what\\'s the point? They all just added to the horror that was MY WASTED THREE BUCKS!!!! In short, consider this my public service announcement to you. Do NOT let go of your hard-earned cash to rent this movie! There are simply no redeeming qualities to it! It\\'s depressing for the sake of being depressing, not for the sake of the storytelling. It\\'s not artsy, it\\'s not independent, it\\'s just CRAP!',\n",

Director Sam Raimi expected this to be R rated and figured most people never saw the unrated (meaning it was X) first one. So, he decided to just redo the movie--just quicker, less gorier and with STRONG doses of comedy (the first one was dead serious). He did it, cut some gore but it was STILL unrated. So it was released (with the gore never put back in) and, like the first, didn\\'t do too well. And, like the first, it quickly acquired a following and is now considered a great movie!<br /><br />Basically once the movie gets going it never stops.

Decent enough premise: odd couple + fish out of water + high jinx.<br /><br />While I miss the sitcoms of yore, this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly, and it's sad because they have some decent talent.<br /><br />On top of everything, they insisted on changing the show (Val was living with a cast regular bf one season, then he was suddenly gone, so she opens a bakery? what?) When things change that drastically, you get the feeling that even the *show* knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, characters written off and new show regulars!<br /><br />On a side note (this is just nitpicking), I know this is a television show and not real at all, but Val and Holly end up living in a HUGE loft duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace... in MANHATTAN!

I found myself alternating between laughs and uncomfortable winces at his utter insensitivity and selfish determination, but it\\'s this dichotomy of emotions that make The Heartbreak Kid the obscure gem that it is. I don\\'t think we can ever be sure if we should like or hate this guy. Two scenes in this movie: \"laying his cards on the table\" over drinks with Kelly and her parents and the breakup scene in the restaurant with Lila, are a sight to behold.

Sure it has some extremes.. but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience, this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings.

The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time, but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid.

              " b'If there\\'s one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it\\'s seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. This \"re-imagining\" of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.<br /><br />There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston\\'s Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can\\'t do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.<br /><br />It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.<br /><br />The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson (Wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. This was poor character development. (Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). Wahlberg\\'s puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.<br /><br />Creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: Ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in The Green Mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon\\'s rocket: jumping apes looked as if they\\'d just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.<br /><br />In the original film, the various \"human\" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief (\"I never knew an ape I didn\\'t like.\" \"Human see, human do!\"). Here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.<br /><br />Nothing made me cringe more than the \"V-Ger from Star Trek\" moment near the end of the film. First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.<br /><br />Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the \\'60s and \\'70s, they generally didn\\'t have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I\\'m thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich\\xc3\\xa9 going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting, you\\'d have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it\\'s \"science fiction\" you don\\'t have to!<br /><br />Overall, Burton\\'s most disappointing film.',\n",

              " b\"First the flaws: 1) The Headmaster is too broad a character. When he mounts the podium at the beginning of the school year, the stern and set expression on his face sets him off as a hidebound traditionalist and curmudgeon. He is the obvious villain here. No free spirit - like Mr. Keating - will last long under him. 2) We viewers are not prepared for Neil's suicide. Through most of the movie he comes across as a well-adjusted seventeen year old. He gets along well with the other boys. He is a natural leader. His penchant for acting appears to stem from serendipity, young male exuberance, and fun. Despite his martinet of a father he does not lie in bed long hours brooding, nor does he ever come across as depressed or manic. So when his father threatens to withdraw him from Welton after his successful debut in a Midsummer Night's Dream, he might argue with his father or turn sullen, but it strains credulity that he would go to directly to suicide. Now the qualities: 3) The production values are excellent. The location is idyllic - New Castle, Delaware is as elegant in reality as it looks in the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, at times lyrical. And the period details are right - like the boys smoking whenever grownups are out of the room - without being forced. 4) I particularly appreciated the acting of Neil's father. He has probably grown up under humble circumstances, and through enormous self-discipline, long hours and weekends of hard work, and seizing the rare opportunities that have come his way, has achieved modest financial success and comfort. At least once he tells Neil how much he has sacrificed for Neil's education at Welton. Neil's a good kid; he's getting straight A's. Like so many fathers in real life this father can't understand his adolescent son. His threat to withdraw Neil from Welton and send him to military school is so extreme it borders on the implausible. I fault the script, not the acting.\",\n",
              " b\"Hilariously entertaining tale of a man with double amnesia: a dull penny pincher on one hand, a thieving con artist on the other. After being conked on the noggin he revives to find he has spent the last nine years as someone he isn't and reverts to his former tricky self. His apple cart is upset when he discovers he is falling for the wife he picked up during the nine year blackout. A plan to bilk some of the locals over a phony oil deal doesn't appear so rosy once his thorny heart is pricked by love, which puts him in danger from a mean tempered associate intent on becoming rich. Fast paced and very funny film, well worth watching, especially Powell's zany character.\",\n",
              " b'I\\'ve seen many of Guy Maddin\\'s films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke\\'s editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors\\' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin\\'s earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed more like harshness for harshness\\' sake.<br /><br />As I\\'m required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing \"Guy Maddin\" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.',\n",
              " b'In-crappy-credible. That\\'s the word that comes to mind. How do movies like this get made? Was there no sane person on the set (never mind, they didn\\'t have a set) who had the guts to tell Claudio Fragasso \"sorry mate, this just ain\\'t gonna work, just give it up already before anyone gets hurt\"? Wow. That\\'s all I can say. I truly cannot summarize how awful this movie is in words. But I\\'ll try, anyway. I have to get this film out of my system before I go insane.<br /><br />Take some rednecks and ex-porn stars, throw them into some anonymous town in the middle of nowhere, slap a huge \"NILBOG\" sign on a pole, hire lots of dwarfs and some sh!tty costumes, and get the most over-the-top, annoying, washed-up Z-movie actress you can find to play the main antagonist, add a delusional kid who is almost as convincing as the thespian from \"Pod People\", and at least twice as irritating, and you have a movie. That\\'s the Claudio Fragasso way! <br /><br />So we have a kid actor with whom we\\'re supposed to sympathize, but he\\'s so bad I just wanted to hit him most of the time and tell him not to be such an overreacting little prick. Seriously, Joshua looks like someone is repeatedly kicking him in the groin whenever he tries to emote.<br /><br />Unbelievably, Joshua isn\\'t the worst actor in the film - even though everyone in this movie either screams or mumbles his or her casual lines , and even though Joshua\\'s mum looks like a crack addict psychopath during most of her scenes, the real Dung Beetle award for incompetent acting has to go to Deborah Reed. She plays Creedence Leonore Gielgud in a way that makes it hard not to think that the nice men in white coats were waiting for Deborah after major shooting of the film had finished. This woman has the scariest eyes I\\'ve ever seen, they\\'re constantly moving up and down, bulging in and out of their sockets so fast even Rodney Dangerfield would be scared. Her eyes are enough to almost distract you from her horrendous overacting, but only almost. Hearing her deliver her \"little flower\" speech makes you pine for the subtlety and depth of Vin Diesel. But enough about her.<br /><br />Can it get any worse? Actually it can, because suddenly a myriad of the aforementioned dwarfs - sorry, I meant goblins - appear. Think of an army of walking, oinking potatoes with bargain bin Halloween masks - those are the goblins. Sound scary yet? I thought so.<br /><br />Kill me now. I thought the film couldn\\'t get any dumber, but it did - suddenly Joshua realizes that \"NILBOG\" is actually \"GOBLIN\" spelled BACKWARDS!!! Yes, I\\'m stunned too. This truly is the most brilliant plot twist this side of M. Night Shyallaman. And so cleverly set up, too! I can assure you I did NOT see this coming, no siree. Gee whizz, what a shocker! All sarcasm aside, this is probably the part of the film where I completely lost it. The sheer look of shock on Joshua\\'s face upon his revelation combined with the \"scary\" music (which was probably stolen from some Japanese TV show from the eighties, by the way) - this is unintentional comedy at its finest. And by \"finest\", I mean \"most painful\".<br /><br />So, when all is said and done, what can we make of this movie? It\\'s low budget, so badly acted you\\'ll want to gouge your eyes out, unintentionally hilarious, blatantly homoerotic (Elliott having trouble choosing between his \"boys\" and his girlfriend, Elliott\\'s \"boys\" sleeping half-naked next to each other) and it gave me the impression that Claudio Fragasso has a fetish for the colour green. In conclusion this film has very deservedly earned itself a position on the Bottom 100, and I\\'m still blown away by the fact that there are movies this irredeemably awful out there. My review has barely scratched on the surface of how awful this film is - it\\'s worse than \"Red Zone Cuba\", worse than \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\", worse than \"Time of the Apes\"... and I wouldn\\'t hesitate to say that it\\'s *this* close to being as bad as \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" (interestingly enough, both films feature a hilarious scene in which the main characters inexplicably burst out in a chorus of \"Row your boat\"). My Bottom 100 marathon couldn\\'t have ended on a higher note of badness and I\\'m happy to say that I survived this ordeal (Watching \"Bloodrayne\", \"Captain America\" and this in a row) without any extensive brain damage... or did I? Anyway, to any devoted fan of bad movies, this is truly appetizing... and provocative. To quote Arnold, one of Elliot\\'s \"boys\": \"OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!\"',\n",

And the director controls the movie in excellent screenplay.And the cast performance is excellent and the animation character gives a grade for a entire movie.<br /><br />Each of the multi-ethnic characters is surrounded by irony, as each time a scene rewinds from another's perspective we find that the characters are not in fact what the other(s) perceive them to be, despite the actions that brought them to intersect.<br /><br />Thanks to director for giving a good movie like February 14.\",\n",

Luggage is in below decks storage rather than in people's staterooms, as if it were an airplane. There is no deckwatch during dinner.

However, it's really just a movie for all the Beavis and Butthead fans out there, for whom plenty of sex and a bit of gunplay makes a film.<br /><br />The utter trashiness of this movie is found in the whole 666 gag. Whenever the protagonists purchase something at a store, the bill totals $6.66. That basically sums up this movie's ambition to be daring and rebellious, but exposes how pathetic these attempts are.<br /><br />Everyone who has branded this movie as dark and daring probably just read the tagline.<br /><br />Maybe that's what makes this movie so 'daring.' I suppose that, in a way, making a pathetically bad film is daring, especially when you put your name on it.<br /><br />Simply put, watching this movie is a painful experience. Hopefully it will claim it's rightful place on the bottom 100 before long. However, maybe that's too good for it.\",\n",
              " b\"The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.\",\n",
              " b'Movies like this that tread heavily into the surreal are fascinating to me. The moon (positive), the hole (negative or inverse of the moon), the man suddenly arising from the still mud (creation). I think that we can consider the movie as \"real\" or plausible if we consider that the characters arise from the writer\\'s consciousness. \"I\\'m going to kill them now (babysitter and her porn-star mother)\" Lorenzo says as he arises from bed, then over to his computer where he starts writing. Why does the dog kill the little girl? Does the dog symbolize lust (note Lucia keeps saying, \"I\\'m dying!\" as she has sex with Lorenzo)? This is all in his head, I think, or in the computer, and finally in the manuscript displayed at the end.',\n",

With some great chase scenes and performance by Marilyn Burns this film amounts to nothing in my mind. What was so scary? Okay so maybe it was scary back in the day and I'm not judging others opinions but I just didn't find anything interesting in this movie. It was boring and the characters were flat and not interesting as they were annoying.<br /><br />I'm glad I watched it and I don't hate it but it's just no classic in my mind. It was just more people go out to Texas to get butchered and barbecued, I just didn't see an interesting enough plot.

              " b'I had high hopes for what I believe to be the only movie about the 10 Tigers of Canton. I\\'ve heard the 10 Tigers of Canton mentioned in passing in kung fu films about Wong Fei-Hung. Fei-Hung was not one of the 10 Tigers, he was known as \"the Tiger after 10\". However Wong Fei-Hung\\'s father Wong Kei-Ying was on of these 10 Tigers. Being a fan of Iron Monkey which featured Wong Kei-Ying as a main character I was looking to find similar movies featuring Wong Kei-Ying as a central character. I\\'ve also seen movies featuring another of the 10 Tigers, Beggar Su, as a minor character. I was quite intrigued to learn more about the 10 Tigers through this film, and to come to an understanding of the aura of mystique and legend that surrounds them.<br /><br />As a tool for gaining insight into the back-story, lives, and importance of these 10 Tigers this Shaw Brothers movie fails miserably. Wong Kei-Ying is a very minor character in this film. Rarely seen on-screen, he and fellow Tiger Wong Chin Ho are simply referred to in passing as \"The Wong Masters\". Beggar Su has a more prominent role in the film, but he does not look, dress, nor act the part of a beggar. Instead we\\'re treated to \"Acrobat Su\". While novel and fresh to use actor Philip Kowk\\'s talent as an acrobat in Five Deadly Venoms, the portrayal of Beggar Su as an acrobat as opposed to a filthy rag-clad beggar left a sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />This film fails to provide background information on each of the 10 Tigers and hence doesn\\'t deliver on explaining who each Tiger is and what made each one such a standout in the world of martial arts.<br /><br />While the costumes, sets, and martial arts action are all phenomenal and top-notch for a 1979 kung fu movie, The lack of character development really hurts this film as it could have been so much more, missing out on making THE one-and-only classic masterpiece about the 10 Tigers of Canton.<br /><br />I can only hope that someday soon a contemporary Hong Kong director will come out with a film that does justice to the 10 Tigers of Canton, because this Shaw Brothers movie fails miserably at doing such.',\n",

The Action was fun and exiting. The Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.<br /><br />Plot - I give this component 10 points.

I found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.<br /><br />Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points.

I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and this had it ALL! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, Charlie Cox made Tristan come to life, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look and Robert De Niro the same again.<br /><br />Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again.<br /><br />Character development - I give this component 9 points. This felt a little rushed and I think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.<br /><br />Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, fun\\xc2\\x85 even the mush had good dialogue.<br /><br />Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. I am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.<br /><br />Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.<br /><br />Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES!

Though I would say I am pro-choice still, this movie educated me in the horrors of partial-birth abortion. Never have I seen a movie that made me think this hard about where I stand on an issue.<br /><br />That being said, I am shocked at all the rave reviews the actors are receiving. I personally though the acting, especially from the lead actress, was atrocious. The defense attorney was decent, and the judge had little else to say but \"sustatined\", but the main character was played by someone with the skill of a mediocre high school play actress.<br /><br />As for the twist at the end, it was a good one, and it shocked most of the people I watched this movie with.

The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us!

              " b'So just to recap the events of the original \"Ginger Snaps\" (SPOILERS!!!), Ginger and Brigette are sisters ... Ginger is bitten by a werewolf ... Ginger begins to turn into a werewolf ... Brigette infects herself with Ginger\\'s blood ... Brigette kills Ginger.<br /><br />We rejoin Brigette after an undisclosed period of time. She\\'s living in a cheap motel room in a city somewhere, shooting up on wolfsbane and keeping a chart of how long it takes for self-inflicted wounds to heal -- hoping against hope that she might never become a werewolf. Occasionally she is visited by the ghost of her dead sister, who haunts and taunts her throughout the movie (you can\\'t have a Ginger Snaps movie without a Ginger, right?). One night she manages to overdose on wolfsbane, and she gets picked up and taken to an outreach centre where she is kept caged like an animal and deprived of the drug ... but what they don\\'t know is that she\\'s being hunted by another deadly werewolf, who has a strong desire to mate with her.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps : Unleashed is even darker than the original, both in the metaphorical and in the literal sense of the word. It\\'s also a lot weirder ... so if, like me, you\\'re a big fan of weird, odds are you\\'ll probably lap this up like a bloodthirsty wolf. There are plenty of great twists and turns in the plot, and the casting is really amazing. Eric Johnson and the young Tatiana Maslany both deliver superb performances in the two main supporting roles. In most respects, many agree that this sequel is in fact better than the first movie ... but they\\'re both so great, I don\\'t even feel the need to compare them.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about the fact that this wasn\\'t written by the same team as the first movie (in fact screenwriter Megan Martin seems to have no other credits to her name), but it is actually an interesting twist on the original, written by someone who clearly understood what Ginger Snaps was all about. There are two main formulaic werewolf plots ... the first involves our hero changing into a werewolf, which will eventually lead either to finding a cure or to their death (as in the first movie), and the second is about a group of characters being stalked by a werewolf, and for an added twist perhaps the werewolf is one of them. This film incorporates both of these formulas into an excellent, engaging horror story.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps is probably the first great werewolf movie to have a worthy sequel, and if that wasn\\'t enough they had to go and do it again a third time. If you haven\\'t seen this whole trilogy yet, you definitely should.',\n",

If there's a few problems with a movie I can usually overlook them but Manic had far too many to just dismiss them. They bothered me the entire movie, especially since they were used to manipulate the audience and advance the plot.<br /><br />Why would a psychiatric ward be co-ed, especially when some of the teenagers are seventeen and some are thirteen? And Joseph Gordon Levitt's character had access to the women's rooms without any problem? That seems kind of ridiculous. If he's a sociopath what's to stop him or anyone else from raping the girls? I also noticed that there were adults in the yard with the teenagers. I don't think that would be allowed. In all likelihood the minors would have absolutely no access to anyone of the opposite sex or anyone over the age of 18 who was also a patient. <br /><br />This movie was self-indulgent tripe. It's too bad because I like Joseph-Levitt as an actor but all the characters were completely one-dimensional. Anarchy guy, Wigger guy, Goth girl. It was completely ignorant of teenagers and mental illness. What the hell did this have to do with being manic or mania or bipolar disorder? Joseph-Levitt was a sociopath. It was just more ultra-cool, hand-held, uber-indie tripe. Indie films used to be good before all this self-indulgent crap started coming out like Garden State.<br /><br />Manic kind of comes across as a corporate public relations bulletin for teens. This is what we think you are. It couldn't have been any more wrong.\",\n",

Let me tell you, it's not a terrific play, it is easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. The acting was really lacking, the scenery-honest to God-looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality is lousy...there is this mind-numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks...and I also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is non-existant. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which would be OK but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more. In any case I think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which I don't really reccomend, then don't aim your hopes to high. The play, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.\",\n",
              " b'\"Cavite\" proves that if the story is good enough, technical excellence is unimportant. Filmed on video with a crew of two, and no budget whatsoever, Cavite is a gripping, roller coaster of a ride. Called to the Philippines, a completely Americanized, young Filipino-American discovers that his mother and sister have been kidnapped. A cellphone planted in his backpack rings and he learns they are held by terrorists and he must follow every direction he is given or they will be killed. Guided by the terrorist\\'s voice on a cellphone, what follows is a tense voyage through the underbelly of Cavite, a city in the Philippines. Although this is at its soul a thriller, by focusing on stark images of third-world poverty, the film cleverly illustrates why terrorist acts have appeal for many. Like all classic thrillers the stakes get higher and higher and the tension grows as the story moves on to its inevitable climax. Although some critics have indicated that they thought the lead actor was lacking in ability I found exactly the opposite -- he is the perfect \"everyman,\" trapped in a situation not of his making. This is great storytelling. I saw this movie twice and recommend it highly.',\n",
              " b'This film is not without merits - but it certainly is no classic. It\\'s aged badly, the characterisation is poor, and there are at least a dozen things about it that really grate, e.g.; the fact that the whole film is an excuse to use special effects; the fact that everyone blindly accepts the existence of ghosts and attributes any strange happenings to them without considering any other explanation; the cheesy horror clich\\xc3\\xa9s; the annoyingly sickly suburban family; the odd moral of the tale (treat those corpses with respect or else!); the American-dream-gone-wrong theme which doesn\\'t quite work (given the fact that this is a 10 on the daft scale); and, last but not least, the fact that one of the paranormal investigators is scared half to death by the crawling meat scene; and yet ten minutes ago, he was happily documenting dozens of levitating objects flying around a bedroom.<br /><br />That said, the special effects are quite good for the time, and the acting does it\\'s best with such a daft story. At this point, you may be thinking; \"this guy just doesn\\'t like the genre\". Not true; but in my opinion, effective, truly scary horror is created by the maxim \"less is more\" - not the more is more approach that Spielberg has employed successfully in other films, and less well here. A disappointment; go watch Ring instead for truly creepy television antics.<br /><br />One last thing; it\\'s appalling this got a PG in the US. One particularly disgusting scene involving peeling flesh is clearly unsuitable for kids, and I can imagine this giving young children nightmares, as hokey as it is. I suggest your kids should be at least twelve before you watch this with them.',\n",

It lacks the imaginative quality of Alice In Wonderland, and substitutes it for random implausible scenarios. The story gives no background for the girl, no idea of who was fighting the war, or why, or if the people she met were real, and mutated by her imagination, or if she manufactured them completely. If she WAS trapped in this place, why did she never try to escape? The basic instinct in a human is to flee from or fear the unknown, of which she did neither.

              " b'Alejandro Jodorowsky is doubtlessly one of the most unique directors in the history of motion pictures. I guess I am not alone by stating that his brilliantly bizarre midnight movie milestone \"El Topo\" of 1970, the surrealist masterpiece \"The Holy Mountain\" (1973) and the stunning \"Santa Sangre\" (1989) all rank among my favorite films, and that there is hardly another living filmmaker I respect as deeply as Jodorowsky. Made eleven years before his impressive feature length debut \"Fando y Lis\" (1968), Jodorowsky\\'s first film \"La Cravate\" (aka. \"Les t\\xc3\\xaates interverties\"/\"The Severed Heads\") of 1957 is a delightful surrealist silent short, which was long considered a lost film. While this film may not be as essential as \"El Topo\" and \"The Holy Mountain\" it is definitely a highly memorable film for lovers of surreal avant-garde cinema and Jodorowsky fans in particular. Jodorowsky made this film when he was in Paris, where he had joined the troupe of celebrated pantomime Marcel Marceau in 1954, and become a part of the surrealist movement.<br /><br />I don\\'t want to get into detail about the plot, so I\\'ll just say this much - the film is a surreal mixture of Fantasy and bizarre love-story which revolves around the possibility of exchanging one\\'s head... The film is set in (a painted) Paris, the characters are entirely bizarre, and some of them very lovable. Jodorowsky himself plays the leading character, and, in his comical costume with a huge collar, has barely any resemblance to the full-bearded gunslinger he would play in \"El Topo\". The film also stars Jodorowsky\\'s future wife Denise Brossot and American actor Saul Gilbert. Gilbert died shortly thereafter, and his wife, who was from Germany, took the only copy home with her after his death. The film then disappeared in an attic for almost half a century, until it was rediscovered in 2006. How lucky for us! Compared to Jodorowsky\\'s later films \"La Cravate\" - the original title refers to the tie worn by Jodorowsky\\'s character - is very harmless and innocent, which also makes it a nice contrast to his other films. While his feature length debut \"Fando Y Lis\" of 1968 is in black and white, this 1957 debut short is very colorful, by the way. All things considered, this is a worthy debut of a cinematic genius, a great short film, and an absolute must for my fellow Jodorowsky-fans.',\n",

The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained together during many years. <br /><br />Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo\\'s: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.<br /><br />Ranma and Akane fight all the time,specially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda,many new characters and situations starts to happen.

              " b'You might initially be reluctant to give \\'The Glass House\\' a try if you\\'ve been turned off by many recent \"thrillers\" as they often have been disappointingly by the book. This is your eerie psychotic chase thriller similar to movies like \\'Pacific Heights\\' and \\'Unlawful Entry.\\' And, though it does play by the rules (unforutnately), there is something about it that makes it more entertaining than the recent dismal fare (not that Pacific Heights wasn\\'t highly entertaining).<br /><br />Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby Baker, a kid going through the terrible teens. When she and her brother\\'s parents die in a car accident, they move in with ultra-modern family friends, Terry and Erin Glass. You know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the Glass couple, but you can never be too sure exactly what at first (that\\'s the purpose of a thriller, to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you\\'re--hopefully--pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed). But, Ruby Baker is a smart kid who\\'s ever-present skepticism about the intentions of her new surrogate parents, and starts trying to figure out what\\'s wrong. Unfortunately, this movie does terribly follow the book when it comes to the main character being disbelieved by other well-meaning characters (social workers, lawyers, teachers, etc.) who consequently pay with their lives for their doubts and unwillingness to really investigate, and in turn, making things worse for poor Ruby. It also follows the book when it comes to the deranged finale and the he\\'s-not-really dead ending.<br /><br />But, there is something that makes this better than most of its kind. On the one hand, you\\'re never sure whether you can always trust Ruby because even she, too, arrogant most of the time, seems like trouble. It\\'s hard to sympathize for a character like that at first. And, not only does Stellan Skarsg\\xc3\\xa5rd make an appropriate villain as Terry Glass, his wife (played by Diane Lane) is not entirely an innocent creature herself as most women are often written to be in the role of the creep\\'s wife/girlfriend/mother, etc. A good mix of characters and a creepy setting, combined with a decent finale, make it just the perfect mix of suspenseful elements. And one that I would recommend seeing.',\n",

I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I\\'m sorry to say, Ms. Ellen\\'s chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy.

              " b'I found Grey Garden\\'s to be a gripping film, an amazingly intimate<br /><br />look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea: forget<br /><br />society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge<br /><br />brood of cats and raccoons, persuing their own interests rather<br /><br />mundainly, all the while chattering at the camera.<br /><br />Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that the Mazles Bros.<br /><br />have chosen to document. They seem like characters out of a<br /><br />Fellini film, only stranger, if that makes any sense. Old Edie is<br /><br />almost fully bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes<br /><br />growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She<br /><br />prances around the house, always wearing a baboushka-like<br /><br />headdress around her head, completely covering her hair. We<br /><br />never see her hair throughout the film, nor do we ever get a hint<br /><br />that she still has much. At age fifty eight, though, she is still<br /><br />beautiful and full of life.<br /><br />In Grey Gardens, we get the sense that both of these women\\'s<br /><br />lives have become much less than what they once were. Little<br /><br />Edie is probably the sadder of the two. While her mother, in her<br /><br />earlier years, got married, made a family, lived luxuriously and<br /><br />even made some recordings (the scene where, at 77, she sings<br /><br />along with a recording of \"Tea for Two\" she made decades ago is<br /><br />one of the films best scenes), Edie left her promicing career as a<br /><br />model to take care of her ailing mother. At 58, she still longed to<br /><br />find her prince charming. If anything Little Edie is still a little girl,<br /><br />full of dreams of glamour and fame, and of domestic and romantic<br /><br />bliss, that have yet to be fulfilled.<br /><br />Highlights of the film include the opening moments, where Little<br /><br />Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the \"tea for two\" sequence,<br /><br />the birthday party, the climactic argument, the grocery deliver<br /><br />scene, and the scene in the attic. The whole thing is incredibly<br /><br />candid and unpretencious. And it\\'s made all the more remarcable<br /><br />since it\\'s all real.<br /><br />I suggest seeing Grey Gardens back-to-back with the Kenneth<br /><br />Anger short Puce Moment.

It\\'s also my first for the Monogram entries, of which this one is the second. In this one, a young woman\\'s stepfather is murdered in a closed room. She enlists Charlie in the case through communicating with his \"No. 3 Son\" Tommy (Benson Fong) while both stay at a hotel. Also along for the ride, for only the second time, is cab driver Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland)...The noticeable changes from Fox to Monogram, besides more comic relief with both Fong and Moreland, is some more time for the music score to go along with some more action sequences near the end before we hear Charlie\\'s assessment of the case. Also, the plotting isn\\'t too serious and Chan\\'s wisecracks to his son seem almost mean-spirited, like Abbott & Costello like, though one can take them with a grain of salt. And while Mantan\\'s antics, especially his looks of fright, would probably not do in these politically correct times, he still can be entertainingly funny with what he does here and I don\\'t think it reflects badly on his race at all since to me he\\'s just a funny looking clown who\\'s quite endearing, whatever the race. So on that note, I quite recommend Charlie Chan in the The Chinese Cat. P.S. Mr. Moreland was a native of Monroe in my now home state of Louisiana. And Sam Flint, who played Thomas P.

The authors, worthy heirs of Jacques Tati (\"Les Vacances de M. Hulot\"/\"M. Hulot\\'s Holidays\", \"Mon Oncle\"/\"My uncle\", ...) , give us a movie full of poetry and refined humor.

              " b'Probably the biggest letdown of my sci-fi viewing life. Even worse than the 3rd \"Alien\" movie. So many bad points that I can\\'t remember them all. I\\'ll touch on the lowlights.<br /><br />First, as the unidentified object approached earth, everyone seemed dumb on the reason for the change in direction. Duh uh, like wouldn\\'t a spacecraft immediately come to mind as a possibility?? Then the excitement and anticipation of a visible ship was taken away by clouds and fog and a vague vessel.<br /><br />As stated elsewhere, the initial contact in the park was ended with Klatu getting shot for an offered handshake (no mysterious equipment popping open). And several times in the movie, there were vehicles, equipment and/or people more evenly spaced out (in large areas) than a marching band.<br /><br />Rather than go over a scene by scene critique, the following complaints come to mind. 1)bad writing; all actors had trite and often repetitive lines. 2)The Secretary of State was scary, illogical, and didn\\'t seem to be in much contact with the bosses(the President and VP). 3)Poor or no acting by the \"Stars\" and the kid. 4) choppy flow, frequently too slow or unclear. Weak continuity, scenes seemed to be just stuck together. 5) Gort was pathetic. Like the recent \"Hulks\", unconvincing CG and too big to realistically show it in contact with humans. (should have gotten Shaq for the part).... 6) No actor to actor chemistry ever formed. 7) The final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the \"standing still\" time and the alien departure. What message did he leave us with? <br /><br />Since I\\'m a poor typist and can\\'t immediately recall all of my issues with the film, I\\'ll end my comments by saying that I have no problem with changing a remake so that it is more up to date and offers some different twists to add interest. However, this film completely missed the mark of maintaining the strengths that the original script had, namely convincing acting with consistent story and character build-up leading to a dramatic final scene with a clear message to all of the world.<br /><br />They could and should have done far far better.',\n",

It\\'s funny, it\\'s cute, it\\'s sweet, and it\\'s very quotable: \"Ruf-i-o,\" \"Bangarang...\" and more.<br /><br />And I love the man who \"lost his marbles,\" literally.

              " b'When you compare what Brian De Palma was doing in the 80\\'s to what passes for entertainment today, his films keep looking better and better. \"Dressed To Kill, \"Blow Out\", \"Body Double\", \"Scarface\" and \"Carlito\\'s Way\" are all superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his powers. The guy had a long run of better than average films. This is pure Hitchcock with an 80\\'s dash of lurid perversion, an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists, huge helpings of style, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot. De Palma\\'s love of complex camera-work and luscious, blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma\\'s wife at the time) and Michael Caine make every scene special. Let the virtuoso take you on a surreal, scary, erotically charged odyssey and you\\'ll enjoy every frame of \"Dressed To Kill\".',\n",
              " b'This was the first of the series that I have seen, having nothing else to do this afternoon and having seen most everything else in theatres that I wanted to see. SPOILERS HEREIN<br /><br />The first segment, entitled \"L.T.R,\" chronicles the relationship of two young twenty something boys (emphatically \"boys\") who meet and \"fall in love.\" They invite a videographer to tape a documentary about the weeks that follow until the relationship is shown to take a turn that neither boy expects. Hopefully, what transpires in the weeks that pass teaches the boys that there is a marked difference between love and lust. This one is by far and away the funniest segment.<br /><br />\"O Beautiful,\" the second segment, was by far and away the most touching. It begins with a boy having just been sexually violated and beaten up by other boys in a dark cornfield. We\\'re spared seeing the attack as the scene begins immediately thereafter. The victim is approached by a young man who arrives on the scene and does what he can to comfort the victim first by wiping the blood from the boy\\'s face, giving him his jeans, and later his letterman\\'s jacket. The \"rescuer\" at one point starts to sing \"America the Beautiful\" at one point while they are engaged in debate over the victim\\'s homosexuality and the brutality of the attack. The rescuer advises the victim in a none too tactful way that he was essentially a victim because his actions displeased God. Although the boy who rescues the victim at first tells him that he left the scene before the attack began, he later admits that he stood and watched while the attackers stripped the boy naked from the waist down and allegedly violates him with a stick. Obviously, it\\'s a stretch of suspended belief that the guy is not bleeding to death from the damage that such an act would cause his internal organs. The segment ends with the rescuer, who basically admits that he was wrong not to protect the victim from the onset and gives him his pick-up truck which the injured boy then drives away in leaving his \"rescuer\" in the middle of the cornfield at night. An understandable, but unsatisfying ending. The acting could have been much better, I would have liked to have seen tears instead of attempts to generate them, but still the most moving of all four segments.<br /><br />\"Bumping Heads\" tells the story of a 35 year old man, Craig, and his twenty something companion, Gary, who are in the emergency room of a hospital as a result of a fight Craig was involved in in a local gay bar. Craig made the unfortunate mistake of trying to save Gary from an lecherous stranger in the back room of the bar, and gets his noggin cracked for his efforts. The physician treating Craig assumes that the two men are lovers because of the way they treat one another, i.e., fawning, finishing one another\\'s sentences, etc. Turns out, Gary has a long term lover who lives on the west coast (the story taking place on the east) and had never mentioned it to Craig. Craig makes one last effort out of many to entice Gary into a romantic relationship that fails miserably because he thinks he has convinced both himself and Gary that the two of them would be great together. This segment, to me at least, was the least interesting and almost pointless.<br /><br />Finally, \"This Car Up,\" which is told quite imaginably (you have to see it for yourself), about two men who seem diametrically opposed to one another in every possible way. Pete is a suit in a downtown office building, Adrian is a multiply-pierced bicycle messenger who have a chance encounter when Pete takes a smoke break outside his office building. They\\'re each smitten by the other and, in the end, find romance in form of a lingering kiss in the building\\'s elevator. The kind of kiss that only two straight actors (I\\'m willing to bet) can share; no tongues. This is the only story that ends with the proverbial \"happy\" attached.',\n",
              " b'Coming immediately on the heels of Match Point (2005), a fine if somewhat self-repetitive piece of \"serious Woody,\" Scoop gives new hope to Allen\\'s small but die-hard band of followers (among whom I number myself) that the master has once again found his form. A string of disappointing efforts, culminating in the dreary Melinda and Melinda (2004) and the embarrassing Anything Else (2003) raised serious doubts that another first rate Woody comedy, with or without his own participation as an actor, was in the cards. Happily, the cards turn out to be a Tarot deck that serves as Scoop\\'s clever Maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of Woody Allen comedy.<br /><br />Even more encouraging, Woody\\'s self-casting - sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years - is here an inspired bit of self-parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters. In Scoop, Allen astutely assigns himself the role of Sid Waterman, an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage-patter who, much like Woody himself, has brought his act to London, where audiences - if not more receptive - are at least more polite. Like Chaplin\\'s Calvero in Limelight (1952), Sid Waterman affords Allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative. Moreover, because they seem in character, Allen\\'s ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time. <br /><br />Waterman\\'s character also functions neatly in the plot. His fake magic body-dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim. Introduced on a River Styx ferryboat-to-Hades, Strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can\\'t rest in eternity without communicating one last \"scoop\" about the identity of the notorious \"Tarot killer.\" Unfortunately, his initial return from the dead leads him to Waterman\\'s magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate, Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician\\'s climactic trick. Sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant Waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father. As demonstrated in Lost in Translation, Johansson has a talent for comedy, and the querulous by-play between her and Allen is very amusing - and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance.<br /><br />Scoop\\'s serial killer plot, involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), is the no doubt predictable result of Allen\\'s lengthy sabbatical exposure to London\\'s ubiquitous Jack the Ripper landmarks and lore. Yet other facets of Scoop (as of Match Point) also derive from Woody\\'s late life encounter with English culture. Its class structure, manners, idiom, dress, architecture, and, yes, peculiar driving habits give Woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire. When, for instance, Sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with Peter Lyman at a ritzy private club, Waterman observes \"from his point of view we\\'re scum.\" A good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved British social manners encountering Waterman\\'s insistent Borscht-belt Jewish plebeianism. And, then, of course, there is Waterman\\'s hilarious exit in a Smart Car he can\\'t remember to drive on the left side of the road.<br /><br />As usual, Allen\\'s humor in Scoop includes heavy doses of in-jokes, taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as, increasingly, references to his own filmography. In addition to the pervasive Jack the Ripper references, for instance, the film\\'s soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of Grieg\\'s \"The Hall of the Mountain King,\" compulsively whistled by Hans Beckert in M, the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre. The post-funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed Joe Strombel clearly mimics the opening of Broadway Danny Rose (1984). References to Deconstructing Harry (1997) include the use of Death as a character (along with his peculiar voice and costume), the use of Mandelbaum as a character name, and the mention of Adair University (Harry\\'s \"alma mater\" and where Sondra is now a student). Moreover, the systematic use of Greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to Hades recalls the use of Greek gods and a Chorus in Mighty Aphrodite (1995).<br /><br />As to quotable gags, Allen\\'s scripts rely less on one-liners than they did earlier in his career, but Scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones. To a question about his religion, Waterman answers: \"I was born in the Hebrew persuasion, but later I converted to narcissism.\" And Sondra snaps off this put-down of Waterman\\'s wannabe crime-detecting: \"If we put our heads together you\\'ll hear a hollow noise.\" All in all, Scoop is by far Woody Allen\\'s most satisfying comedy in a decade.',\n",
              " b\"You'd have to be a fan of farces to like this. It has some novel ideas, such as illegally obtaining a fresh cadaver that has to be transported from the city morgue to the school, while rigor mortis is beginning to set in. Alan Arkin has a secondary, not a starring, role. He brings more to the part than the writer gave him. Steve Guttenberg is surprisingly good as the son of a doctor who can't get into an American medical school, or even a first or second grade foreign one. Curtis Armstrong, in particular, is terrific in his medical student role. Over all, however, this is strictly a B movie. Julie Haggerty is terrible as the glamorous student with whom the school director (Arkin) is enamored. There is nothing alluring about her looks, and her approach to comedy acting is out of sync with the rest of the cast's.\",\n",
              " b'Although a tear jerker it is definitely a \"feel good\" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith as always, does the job and does it well. I could go on but pick any ten of the \"10\" ratings and they\\'ve said it as well and likely better than I could. <br /><br />BUT, since I must include at least 10 lines to post a comment I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was most enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come.<br /><br />AND, this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.',\n",
              " b'WARNING: My comments should be regarded as - a sad old sod\\'s musings on a movie remembered fondly from his youth! I\\'m not going to dissect the movie scene by scene. I won\\'t compare Forsyth\\'s earlier works with his best known or \"finest\" moments. I\\'m not even going to discuss any particular aspect of the film! Not the setting, the story, the dialogue, not even the individual performances! I\\'m simply going to say that I remember watching this movie (with my family) on TV back in the early eighties and laughing so hard it actually hurt! I have no idea if it has aged well or not because I haven\\'t seen it in over 20 years but I will say this in it\\'s favour/defence, \"That Sinking Feeling\" gave Glasgow a voice and a character that\\'s rarely been heard before nor since! Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not a Glaswegian so I have no personal axe to grind in that respect, I just feel that the human face of Glasgow (or Scotland for that matter) hasn\\'t been depicted quite so sympathetically as in this movie. It seems to me that, when contemporary filmmakers try to present an \"honest\" depiction of the Glaswegian he tends to go for the \"gritty realism\" of the drunk or the druggie or the wife beating hard-man! That Sinking Feeling took a different tack and demonstrated the dry Scottish humour we all recognise (even more-so, we natives of Scotland) and perhaps that\\'s why we seem to remember it so fondly. Anyway, if you can find a copy, watch it! Just don\\'t expect any cool CG effects or Seinfeldesque banter, just good clean working class urban banality and the comedic observations you\\'d expect from a good clean working class director feeling his way!<br /><br />Incidentally, sometime back in 1992/3 I met the redheaded actor (shamefully I can\\'t recall his name right now) from \"That Sinking Feeling\" working in Stirling castle, conducting tours and the like! Not only does he star in one of my favourite productions, he is also an all round, really nice guy!<br /><br />Bonus!',\n",
              " b\"Finally had a chance to see it. Goulet and Howes have such rich voices. Production values are 1960's, but if you get away from the fact that they are singing/acting on a set, what a joy to see. Definitely plays better as a musical then the dance/musical of Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse (although that version would have been great, too, if they didn't film it on a set.<br /><br />Also, Peter Falk plays Goulet's friend. And he's not just comic relief - he actually acts and is the voice of logic for Goulet, who believes he may be hopelessly in love. The songs are thoughtful, wistful, even sad in a heroic way.\",\n",
              " b\"Near the closing stages of Baby Mama, one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess'; I really couldn't say it any better than that. And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again, the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time. A lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour. Consisting mainly of very routine, clich\\xc3\\xa9 jokes based around an odd couple (rich and poor) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world, the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic.<br /><br />As a story on finding love, it's not that bad, but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent, characterisation is notably weak, resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles. As characters themselves, both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces, but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness; so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times, the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles; we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting, but rather their dynamic. Unfortunately however, although this dynamic works best, or at least better than the individual personas, as mentioned above, it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula.<br /><br />Kate (Tina Fey) is a successful business woman who has hired working class, dumb-blonde Angie (Amy Poehler) to be her unlikely surrogate, and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl (Dax Shepard), both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences. Yes, it's the typical odd-couple premise, and one that we have already seen in this year's What Happens in Vegas, yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters. Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air. In fact, the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man. Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama, most of those moments were because of this man, and the remainder usually fell to Shepard.<br /><br />It's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera, and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough. Yet, for a film about babies, multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping, this isn't necessarily a good thing. Baby Mama is grade-A, hammy, plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar. So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature, but I simply didn't care for the world they inhabited. The dialogue, along with sets, costumes, and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy; these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any way\\xc2\\x85 so why should I care? At the end of the day however, a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests, and the frequency of its laughs; Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments. Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair. I'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings, but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored. In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable, but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch, Baby Mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\",\n",

That having been said, this film isn't entertaining on *any* level. It's slowly paced, nothing ever really happens, inexplicably Dr. Moreau attempts to turn Michael York into an animal, and ultimately the film goes no where. On the small plus side?

Good little wussy role by Ben Stiller; nice supporting job by Helen Hunt.

Of course nothing wrong with this, since it definitely makes the movie an entertaining and bit of adventurous one. But in this case the approach doesn't really work out, since it also obviously is a movie that wants to be taken seriously and has a clear message in it. You know, the kind of message to 'save the rain forest'. It also uses lots of technology vs. nature elements. I'll admit that this movie is a better attempt than all Steven Seagal attempts combined but no, that doesn't mean that this movie is a perfect or truly successful attempt on its own. The movie seems to lack the proper emotions to see this as a completely effective one, though the right intentions are definitely there. I mean for instance, the characters within this movie see each other again for the first time in 10 years but yet they seem hardly affected by it all.<br /><br />The natives scenes also aren't always among the best or most interesting one's out of the movie. Sure the nature environments are beautiful looking but it slows the movie a bit down in the middle, which also is in big contrast with the serious and dramatic first part of the movie and the action filled final part.

Scorsese breaks cinematic rules with such artistry that we\\'re allow to inspect, re live and enjoy a story as old as the world from a completely new perspective. Is as if Luchino Visconti had suddenly woken up with a new contemporary sight to look back with. Daniel Day Lewis is so marvelous that the pain of his predicament becomes more than visual, becomes visceral. For Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder this was the zenith of their careers. They are sensational. The casting, as usual in a Scorsese film, is superb even in the smallest roles. Glimpses of Sian Phillips, Alexis Smith and Geraldine Chaplin add to the pleasures, making this overwhelming banquet of a film one of the most rewarding film experiences I\\'ve ever had.',\n",

Frannie strongly objects to the idea, and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were, by getting a job and maintaining responsibility.<br /><br />In comes handsome Ruben and the two soon fall in love (as you do), and it's from this point that I sort of lost interest....<br /><br />There is more to Farrah Fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks, she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary Charlie's Angel.<br /><br />Silk Hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful TV image, and you know there was a limit to the budget, but it's not the worst film ever made.

Sure enough, he is careful not to say anything that would offend anyone, and as a result all you get is a bland movie where everything is sort of cancelled out by everything else. Frontier women are strong and self-reliant, except that sometimes they need help from menfolk. Indian warriors are brave and good, except that some of them are evil and brutal. Violence is tragic, except sometimes it's the only way. The white settlers really want to be nice to the good Indians, but somehow they all get killed in the big gun battle. So of course it's nobody's fault they're all gone. Nothing happens here that didn't happen in LAST OF THE MOHICANS, except with no romance at all and very dull characters mucking about in dirt and snow and looking miserable.<br /><br />What would have made this movie work would have been a strong love story between Cate Blanchett and -- well, not Tommy Lee Jones, but maybe some powerful Mexican landowner or something. Like they get down to Mexico and Cate's daughter has been stolen, so she has to see the incredibly rich and aristocratic Mexican governor, who is an older man and a widower. And he helps her get her daughter back, riding by her side like a guardian and protector, only he and Cate fall madly in love so at the end she stays on in Mexico living in his hacienda and being treated like a queen. And instead of Cate in the dirt and snow all the time you would see her enjoying new clothes and new surroundings and trying on jewelry and things like that, with her very distinguished husband sort of smiling at her in the background. And her bratty daughter could just marry some nice young officer.<br /><br />And Tommy Lee Jones could get eaten by a pack of Gila monsters.\",\n",

Lloyd\\'s pursuit of the serial killer puts his job on the line and pushes him over the edge. Tightly written and directed by James B. Harris (who previously worked with Woods on the outstanding prison movie \"Fast-Walking\"), with crisp cinematography by Steve Dubin, a harsh, gritty tone, unflinchingly raw and profane dialogue, a jazzy, shivery score by Michel Colombier, a tense and exciting climactic showdown between Hopkins and the killer, some seriously ugly violence (the murder sites are truly nasty), and a shockingly brutal and nihilistic ending, this bang-up little sleeper makes for an extremely gripping and suspenseful viewing experience. Woods effortlessly carries the picture with his usual arresting blend of live-wire energy and hard-boiled charisma.

              " b'Okay... it seems like so far, only the Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint. Beware, this writeup is *LONG*.<br /><br />For those not in the knowing (mostly the non-Belgians) : Tom Barman, director of this film, is the frontman of dEUS, one of the better known rock bands of the late 90\\'s here in Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale. Then, egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart, with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUS-monicker. The way it always happens in such cases, the post-breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album \"The Ideal Crash\" in 1999, presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting. They didn\\'t quite make it. However, egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies.<br /><br />More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake, and this film does not make the exception. And Barman clearly went for *art* on this one, another very big mistake. For one thing, he\\'s a musician, not a movie director. For another, dEUS at it\\'s best made fun and provoking music, but never anything close to what I would consider *art*. It shows.<br /><br />So, what\\'s this movie about? Basically, it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people, doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp, as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting. The characters are shallow, the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn\\'t have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh (not quite loud). Mood? The film just doesn\\'t seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well, (*MINOR SPOILER*)the idea of the \"wind-man\", inspiring the name of the film, is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very, and has been done a thousand times before (anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino\\'s worst appearances on film to date)(*END MINOR SPOILER*). And well, its *artistic*, so don\\'t expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. In other words, except for the few smiles, it bored me out of my shorts.<br /><br />So what remains? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST\\'s have shown lately : first, it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD. Second, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs, which simply doesn\\'t work. In the end, it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. And sadly, it\\'s Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention, though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I\\'m concerned. All in all, it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is okay as well, though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.<br /><br />The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of \"guess-the-location\" game. I would hardly consider this as a quality though.<br /><br />All in all, another chance lost for Flemmish film. I keep on noticing that lately, the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country. This is mostly because at least, they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional (the brothers Daerden come to mind). Maybe the Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too.',\n",

He claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke. But the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage.<br /><br />Steven Seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel, the lead role this time round goes to Bill Golberg (Steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end.) But there's a reason he hasn't done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners. Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.<br /><br />This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it. It does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along. **\",\n",

Unfortunately for them, he was...and now he\\'s after them, determined to give them all his undivided attention...one victim at a time.<br /><br />The death scenes in HELLBENT are just as stunning as the ones in HAUTE TENSION, though it leavens the horror with enough campy humor to put it in the \\'typical slasher film\\' category, lacking TENSION\\'S brute-strength and pitch-black tone. Paul Etheredge-Ouzts definitely knows his horror just as well as TENSION\\'S creators, but the more positive take he puts on the \\'gay\\' angle will make it more accessible to gay and straight audiences alike.<br /><br />And wait till you get a load of HELLBENT\\'S inventive and suspenseful \"trick\" ending.

This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now.

I only wonder why it didn't happen even earlier. He passes a sign saying that sparring partners are wanted, people who know how to take a punch, and heads in. We see him grow increasingly concerned as one guy after another, all bigger and stronger than him, get up to fight and return in a state of dazed semi-consciousness. <br /><br />A lot of times when I watch these early comedies from Chaplin, I get the feeling that he is often trying to create at least a mildly engaging story throughout which he can throw in a lot of kicking and punching scenes, but in this movie it's the kicking and punching the drives the plot, giving the film an unusually honest feel. <br /><br />High-energy physical slap-stick is what Chaplin did best at that time, and smacking around a huge mountain of a man while he dances carelessly around as only he can is certainly a treat to watch. And the climactic battle between Charlie and the meaty Bob Uppercut (or Young Hippo, depending on which cannibalized version you may see) is well-acted and fun. <br /><br />Mack Sennett like his comedies to be fast paced and high energy, without too much time wasted on things like characterization or even story. But in The Champion, Chaplin proves that we can have well-developed characters, an easily discernible story, and still have enough action and solid slap-stick to keep the shorter attention spanned audience members entertained. This is definitely one of the best short comedies that Chaplin had made up to that point.\",\n",

The movie continues with several twists of fate, until Paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement, and found by a Russian custodian, who is touched by the bird's story. the plot is in keeping with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift, and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding. A beautiful mixture of flute, digital base, and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy. The sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more. And, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable.

On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you'll be very disappointed.<br /><br />Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment: <br /><br />* While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children's view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery.<br /><br />* The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues.<br /><br />* In England, driving is on the left. The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when it could have easily parked immediately behind, or even on the side; as the huge truck did.<br /><br />* The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime, but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall.<br /><br />* Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting.<br /><br />* It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk.<br /><br />* It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators \\xc2\\x96even coaxing her daughter to do the same-- while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park.<br /><br />* The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow/dimwitted --justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother\\xc2\\x97 but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate.<br /><br />There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado's disappointment.

The husband of Raynelle Slocumb (Whoopi Goldberg) suddenly kicks the bucket while eating breakfast at the kitchen table. He leaves his wife not with wonderful memories but with only two adjectives to describe him: mean and surly. This incident triggers a family reunion to celebrate the life of their relative. Most of the family members hate each other and are not particularly happy with their awkward ruination.<br /><br />The family members all appear to be spoof material from some stale TV soap opera.

The script gives the variety of eccentric characters unique little quirks that replace development but establish their lifestyles. It\\'s funny how the movie begins and ends with the Whoopi Goldberg character. She is the only person in the family with whom we connect. She realizes that her relatives are resentful fools, and provides us with a kind of wisdom that really benefits the movie. <br /><br />\\tThe film is based on the play by David Dean Bottrell and Jessie Jones, who also wrote the jumbled, unorganized screenplay. Director Doug McHenry does not provide the story with much focus or interest. There\\'s about four subplots of equal importance, but we never actually care about any of the characters. Some of the characters are truly irritating, like a clueless Reverend, played by Cedric the Entertainer, who was so witty and edgy in Spike Lee\\'s \"The Original Kings of Comedy.\" Here he is simply a medium for the film to spew ungraceful humor; his speech mannerism and character development are painfully unfunny. No matter, the movie continuously stretches his stupidity, especially during a closing scene of obligatory fart jokes during a funeral reception. This scene may be somewhat funny, but its context, it is way out of place. <br /><br />\\tA top-notch cast delivers a variety of situation characters, including Raynelle\\'s alcoholic son (LL Cool J in a performance worthy of the Razzie Award), and his scolding wife (Vivica A. Fox). Her daughter (Jada Pinkett Smith) is married to an adulterer (Anthony Anderson). Another daughter is Marguerite (Loretta Devine), who tries hard to control her slacker son (Darius McCrary). There is also a rich loudmouth Cousin (Toni Braxton) and I already mentioned the gaseous Rev. Hooker (Cedric the Entertainer).<br /><br />\\t\"Kingdom Come\" is a movie obviously driven by moral beliefs and powerful conviction, and while its intentions are noble and understood, it never manages to get its point across clearly. The film just cannot successfully display its message in context to the story on screen. It tires to be a warm-hearted, family-orientated comedy like \"Soul Food,\" but does not hold the same standards for itself. What we end up with is a preachy but whimsical comedy that can\\'t make up its mind whether it wants us to laugh or join the chorus.',\n",
              " b'OK, I don\\'t really think that Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines, because they kick ass. They just... conflict with each other.<br /><br />For Example: Near the end of the movie, it shows Ricky and Julian telling \"Patrick Lewis\" to put the dog down and walk away. Then at the end, it shows Ricky and Julian saying that they\\'ve been in jail for 2 years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian yelling at \"Patrick Lewis\". But in the TV series, they\\'ve supposedly only been in jail for 18 months.<br /><br />Also, they give us the impression that the movie\\'s story line and the TV series\\' story line are connected (because of the yelling scene between the guys). But some actors portray totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays \"Patrick Lewis\" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination, and then he plays Sam Losco in the series.<br /><br />Also (again... I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash. The thing is, they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway, other than the yelling scene.<br /><br />Sorry to keep on blabbing.',\n",

Give or take slight exaggeration, it portrays a clear example of the media's influences of mindless western masses to an immoral act that the majority of human instinct should be able to over power. I do believe killing is a natural animal instinct that as an evolutionary species, most humans should be able to distinguish as wrong. Yet when these 'natural born killers' create these anomalies of the human being, through media their faults can be praised and cheered, as the decreasing presence of morals, values and individuality of western society become history. But maybe all is not lost in western society. It is uplifting to see a couple truly devoted to each other. However, as this film appears slightly exaggerated in some respects, maybe by removing the rose tinted glasses, it would end in divorce.\",\n",

In this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder, opposite the film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance.<br /><br />One of the images that will always stay with me from this film, is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which Thorne (Heston) has to hop through them every time he uses them.<br /><br />The movie's use of music is note worthy too, although it contains no score in the usual sense, The opening theme is good, and the subsequent snatches of music we here in Simonson's apartment, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric.\",\n",

Unfortunately Matthew Saliba's Pandora's Paradox is not one of these films. I happened to catch this short film at a New York film festival and I was far from entertained. Clocking in at about twenty minutes this film was a long watch and I found myself looking at the clock several times. This to me seems like the easy way to make a film nowadays, throw a bunch of random images on the screen, add some cheesy colored lighting, and toss in some annoying sound and voila end of the semester film project. What happened to constructing a well written screenplay? fully fleshed out characters? or even creating something original. The story has something to do with a boy, some doctors, a weird old guy with a phallic object on his underwear and a giant toe which somehow all leads to the main character and his withdrawal from life. The acting seemed like it was way better than your typical student film but it was hard to tell when the parts we're reduced to annoying laughter and screaming. Basically this film did nothing but annoy me and I can't really even think of a reason to recommend it. If you enjoy these kind of student films then this might be up your alley but Unless your looking for a Pretentious David Lynch knockoff stay far away from this film.\",\n",

The concept of the Donkey Punch - a sex act involving aggressive contact, applied to the back of a chick\\'s neck whilst performing anal copulation - was interesting, but that was really IT for the \"thrill\" aspect after that particular scene... We start off with the standard group of pea-brained party-girls vacationing in Spain, who meet up with some guys with a boat. There, it feels like an hour of pointless prattle, then a hot scene of group sex, Donkey Punch resulting in an accidental neck-snap, followed up by the whole \"lets ditch the body and get out of here\" routine... Strange how I\\'ve heard such positive things about this UK flick, because I actually found it enormously dull and drawn out. Not a whole lot of violence either - the best scene is an expected flair-gun blast that\\'s pretty funny, but otherwise there\\'s not much on that end... If only \"Donkey Punch\" had SOMEWHERE to go, plot-wise, after the first 30 minutes or at least tacked on a bit more T&A and a lost LESS of that hair lipped-meth-head and overly forced \"alpha-woman\" BS, it might have been able to hold my interest a little better.

It\\'s not intelligent enough to even be viewed as some warped social commentary and it\\'s not ambitious enough to do anything other than present gratuitous T&A and gore in the dullest manner imaginable. Hell, it\\'s not even entertaining. What it really is an exercise in being completely and utterly pointless aside from presenting violent scenarios and nude women with in third world countries with unlikely silicone enhanced bodies. Oh yeah, the plot involves a trio of students (two Americans and a foreigner) vacationing in Eastern Europe who eventually stumble upon a pay-to-slay type business that specializes in making your sickest dreams come true (i.e. customers pay a high price to get to slaughter a real live person). And I am using the world \"eventually\" because it takes around an hour for this movie to get to the real horror content. First we have to sit through an excruciating hour dedicated to the juvenile frat boy antics of characters who stay wasted on booze and drugs and pay hookers for sex. A whole hour of this crap.<br /><br />Our \"heroes\" are stupid, irritating, immature, one-dimensional, unlikable and by the time their lives are in danger, you could care less what happens to them. I know I didn\\'t. I was actually rooting for the generic, anonymous bad guys to tell you the truth. To make matters worse, this film has a tacked on ending that tries to let the sole survivor enact his vengeance. These scenes are absolutely ludicrous and riddled with coincidence that certain characters just happen to be at a certain place at the right time. Hey, there\\'s three of them now crossing the street right in front of me just as I\\'m trying to escape the town! Well what do you know? How bout I run \\'em all over! There\\'s another one who happens to be on the same train as me as I\\'m leaving the country! Well I\\'ll follow him into the bathroom... etc. etc. etc. The end.<br /><br />This movie is absolute garbage from start to finish. It\\'s nothing new or interesting. There is some gore, but it\\'s pretty much what\\'s expected and nothing too shocking for anyone who has already sat through films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Dawn of the Dead. Director Eli Roth may be 35 years old, but his brain functions at the level of someone 20 years his junior based on his juvenile screenplay and uninspired direction. Roth himself later claimed to make this film \"to show Americans\\' ignorance of the world around them\" and in the process only shows his own ignorance when it comes to film-making.

This has nothing to do with hip hop. The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, and their are several sequences that have irritating static over the dialogue.<br /><br />I saw this film during its world premiere in Philly and I am ashamed it had anything to do with Philadelphia. I understand it was meant not to be a masterpiece, but instead like great pics like the Naked Gun and Airplane, but this had no flow to it the scenes made no sense. Like the ridiculously bad and unfunny scene where KO is tied up and two chicks come in and act crazy and take his pants off. Oh and the scene where two goons tie up KO and leave him in his office, why would you tie him up just to leave him in the same place he was at? Myself and my date could not get to sleep over how bad this film was. If anyone even remotely found this funny please tell me why because I will be in disbelief. This is the first and probably last film I will ever submit anything to on this site because it is that bad. the only person in this film that still should have some dignity left is the chef guy who claimed all black people are addicted to ranch dressing, that scene was not bad.<br /><br />Again, this has nothing to do with hip hop, it has one scene where a white guy raps and that is all, so where the title came from I do not no. this is what happens when a white director tries to make a film about black culture, do yourself a favor and stay away.',\n",

              " b'I have a feeling that many of us have entertained the whimsical notion, as we dragged ourselves to work in the morning, that it might be nice to have hot coffee fed intravenously into our systems. Well, in the misleadingly titled Boris Karloff vehicle \"The Man With Nine Lives\" (1940), we get to see that such a procedure might be as pleasant as imagined. In this picture, experimental patients of one Dr. Mason, who\\'s looking to cure cancer victims via cryogenics, are brought out of deep freeze in just that manner! Dr. Mason and his nurse fianc\\xc3\\xa9e soon discover the body of cryogenics pioneer Dr. Leon Kravaal, 100 feet underground in a Canadian ice cave, where he\\'d been laying frozen--a corpsicle--for a full decade. Dr. Kravaal (played by Karloff, of course, in still another of his overly ardent scientist roles) is remarkably brought back to life, and begins his scientific pursuits anew. Anyway, this film is a fairly restrained affair, impeccably acted by its small cast, economically written, nicely photographed, and captured here on a pristine-looking DVD. The goateed Kravaal, likable at first, grows increasingly deranged as the film progresses, but still manages to hold the audience\\'s sympathies; a brilliant scientist using unethical methods to achieve great ends. Despite the far-fetched central conceit of the possibility of freezing a man indefinitely and bringing him back to life, the movie is fairly believable; a testament to its intelligent script and fine players. But wait...did I say \"far-fetched\"? I have a feeling that Walt Disney, Ted Williams and thousands of frozen sperm cells the world over might disagree with that sentiment!',\n",

The final evening where the winner is crowned is one of the most beautiful and compelling moments I've scene in documentary film. Beautifully styled shots and a sparse yet rich sound design leaves you feeling emotionally drained by the end. The way the film cuts from the backstage frenzy to the silence, beauty and calm serenity of the girls on the stage is absolutely breathtaking. Attempting to do a film on a beauty pageant could very easily have been nothing more than fluff, but this is a film that doesn't try to uncover anything more than the raw emotions that happen during the pageant.\",\n",
              " b\"Unfortunately rather overlooked as this film came out the same year as Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's 'Todo Sobre mi Madre' which went on to reach fame and glory. However, if you liked Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's excellent drama you will also like 'Solas'. The two films have certain similarities inasmuch that also in 'Solas' the accent is very much on strong characterisation, profound human feelings, though perhaps a little less intense here than in Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's film. <br /><br />Ana Fern\\xc3\\xa1ndez is magnificent, playing just right the rather confused, unlucky thirty-five year old young woman a bit given to alcohol, not overplaying her part; Mar\\xc3\\xada Galiana as her mother shows even at her age that she has come from good theatre, as no less does Carlos \\xc3\\x81lvarez-Novoa as the lonely neighbour. Benito Zembrano - as Almod\\xc3\\xb3var - , not only directs his film but is also responsible for the script, which is truly magnificent, especially taking into account certain Andalucian styles of speech. The Andalucian accent may at times cause a bit of a problem if you know Spanish a fair amount and watch this film without any subtitles. Try it, anyway: it is well worth the effort. <br /><br />An excellent piece of drama which certainly deserves more recognition than it has got.

              " b'I have a severe problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I\\'ll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour.<br /><br />If you don\\'t wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn\\'t) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I\\'ll summarize: Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV, \"Two And A Half Men\" and \"The King Of Queens\" as the television executives. Now then, on with the review.<br /><br />These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn\\'t Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel\\'s enemy? Why doesn\\'t Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, cause he\\'s the dumb one and he\\'s comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility.<br /><br />The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be \"comedy\" requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development).<br /><br />This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn\\'t right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I\\'ve provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven\\'t heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /><br />I have watched very little of \"Friends\" in my life, but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. If you\\'ve read this far, thank you, and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned.',\n",

They took a lot of liberties in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30\\'s. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. in the gang at various times, and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout, and in fact got drawn back into crime. Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie\\'s wound was much more severe and never healed right. It was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up, and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe. I know, I\\'m being nit picky, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this \"TRUE\" story, the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives, rather than being a cohesive flowing story.<br /><br />I\\'d recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.',\n",

With some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. The main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. Normally a person in his situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and God. And they provide the answer for his problem. It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it always is helpful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. While the message is good,it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie. The mystery that is presented to us never gets solved. In stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Don't get fooled because of Malcolm Mcdowell. The once brilliant actor is adequate,but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all. He really must be desperate for money. Otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.\",\n",

Without revealing any plot details--on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place. It was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard. Later on, in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven. This was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldn't be an option. These continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had. Also, I found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver.

This film let\\'s you make up your own mind about it without apologizing for that. Unlike colombine and some others who spoon feed you one sided muck.

              " b'Fox\\'s epic telling of one a America\\'s greatest pioneering efforts comes to DVD with some truly outstanding \"Extras\". BRIGHAM YOUNG (The \"Frontiersman\" was added for the European release), telling the story the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration brought members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)out to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after mobs murdered their prophet/leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America was about to enter World War II. It was a daring move on Fox chief, Darryl F. Zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the Mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen. Now Fox, working with James D\\'Arc, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this film to the DVD format in an outstading edition. Mr. D\\'Arc, who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film, has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a DVD. He seperates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why this films was so much appreciated by Church Leaders even though embellishments to the truth run throughout the film. One of the fun bits of information deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film he married a Latter-saint woman and was eventually converted to the LDS faith. There is much to be learned from D\\'Arc\\'s knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the DVD! There are over 100 pictures from the Fox & BYU Archives included on the disc, plus newsreel footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in Salt Lake City. Thanks FOX for another outstanding DVD -- and thank you, James D\\'Arc for your great commentary!',\n",
              " b\"Kansas City Confidential is an excellent film noir on the cheap. It stars John Slightly Scarlet Payne playing a revenge-minded ex-con trying to even the score. (He's framed while driving a truck full of posies - probably the most unlikely guy to be framed for a bank job.) Like his part in 99 River Street, director Phil Karlson has Payne playing it both tough, street smart and at the same time good hearted. Yet there's no doubt that he could turn into a killer at any moment. The heist and eventual double crosses are good and very clever for this type of crime picture. I was also surprised (in a good way) that the movie showed some of the police as corrupt - by showing a false arrest and eventual beating. Not to mention a very bad cop behind it all. This movie proves once again that b-noirs were just as good as the big budget ones with Mitchim and Lancaster. And how about the bad guys? Lee Van Cleef AND Jack Elam. Nice.<br /><br />The film's title is misleading, though. Only a very small part of the film takes place in Kansas City. Almost all of it is in Mexico.\",\n",
              " b\"Michael Sopkiw plays Kevin Hall, a paleontologist who hitches a ride on a plane travelling to Dinosaur Valley, a fossil hunter's paradise deep in the cannibal-infested Amazon jungle. But when the plane crashes en route, he and the other survivors (a photographer and his model, a Vietnam veteran and his wife, and a scientist's daughter) must attempt to reach civilisation on foot, without losing too many body parts on the way.<br /><br />Although the Italian cannibal craze had pretty much run its course by the mid 80s, a handful of directors tried in vain to scrape a little more meat off an already well-picked carcass, and delivered several offerings that did little to reignite interest in the genre.<br /><br />Ruggero Deodato, of Cannibal Holocaust fame, directed the fairly enjoyable Cut and Run, an adventure movie with a little gut munching to spice up events, and Mario Gariazzo presented Amazonia, an unexceptional tale (actually about headhunters) that still managed to successfully capture some of that savage vibe that we cannibal fans know and love.<br /><br />Michele Massimo Tarantini, meanwhile, gave us Massacre in Dinosaur Valley, a trashy (ie. it has plenty of hot nekkid women in it) B-movie style affair that totally misses the mark. With a fraction of the gore that fans have come to expect from the genre (the only memorable moment being a fun piranha attack), particularly dreadful acting, and a group of unlikeable characters you actually look forward to seeing being eaten alive, I found Tarantini's movie to be one of the weakest Italian cannibal films I have seen.<br /><br />Some viewers seem to have enjoyed this one's general shoddiness, awarding it 'so-bad, it's good' status, but I don't think it manages to pull off that particular trick. In fact, part of me suspects that Massacre in Dinosaur Valley was intentionally made to be bad. Which doesn't make it good. Just bad. Which I guess, would make it a success. Except that I didn't enjoy it that much.<br /><br />Ah, stuff it..... 4/10 for the quality T&A.\",\n",
              " b'\"Believers\" is your very average end of the world/suicide cult movie if not for the fact that it was directed by Daniel Myrick, one half of the director duo behind \"The Blair Witch Project\", if only Mr. Myrick had used one half of his brain too then this might not have ended up such a total mess.<br /><br />Obviously, the Hollywood producers didn\\'t trust the film-making skills of the \"Blair Witch\" creators, since, they both have been virtually inactive in the new millennium so far. Still, it seems that Myrick had enough time on his hands to hatch a few cinematic eggs. Since last year, he was not only producing \"Rest Stop\" (which I kind of liked) but also directed another three feature length movies (\"The Objective\", \"Solstice\" and \"The Strand\"). Although, it remains to be seen whether they will make it beyond a straight-to-video release. As for \"Believers\" it pretty much follows the formula of \"The Blair Witch Project\", but while the twist in that movie consisted of surpassing our fear that the witch was real in \"Believers\" we are introduced to a bunch of frauds that in the very end... I really don\\'t want to spoil it for you here, because the movie has not much else going for it than the twist ending, and even that twist is paper thin, almost as if Kevin Costner at the end of \"Water World\" had found out that he belonged to the latest Sea World attraction (no, it\\'s actually not THAT bad). The story of \"Believers\" is about two paramedics who are on an emergency call to rescue a woman lying conveniently in front of a gas station, having some sort of a heart attack. Subsequently, David Vaughn and his partner Victor are abducted by a bunch of weirdos who take them inside an old bunker where their fellow cult members reside. I forgot the name of the cult, it\\'s probably some Greek letter of the alphabet. From there on, it\\'s pretty much business as usual. There\\'s the sinister end of the world cult and it\\'s mysterious cult leader, lots of teaching and indoctrination, members who try to escape but are caught (the woman with the heart attack and here little daughter), some attempted brainwashing of the paramedics, large gas canisters with the required bio-hazard warnings all over them and a lot of mumbo jumbo about numbers and how God can be found in science and such. The story arch, if you can call it that, largely consists of Vaughn\\'s partner Victor having a spiritual crisis and slowly turning over to the dark side (hey, it\\'s a character driven movie!). A lot of hokey acting is involved in that process and finally culminates in a scene where Victor gets to bang a hot cult member chick. Well, who can resist the power of love? Overall, this is a fairly weak effort to give a new spin on the old evil suicide cult story, which would have worked a lot better as a short movie instead of a feature length film. The material is too second rate and the actor\\'s are too third rate to carry this anywhere but the nearest lowest price blockbuster bargain bin. There is too much focus on the twist ending and not enough substance to sustain it. In order for the twist to succeed the movie has to lull the audience into the belief, that there are religious fanatics at work here like we\\'ve seen them a thousand times on TV and congregating in the living room of our neighbor\\'s house. The \"show them something ordinary and at the end reveal that they have witnessed something extraordinary\"-formula usually works better in the short form. Here, the cult\\'s religion is not intriguing enough to merit any second thoughts as to whether their predictions about an imminent doomsday might actually be true and grounded in hard evidence. ***imminent spoiler ahead*** Finally, when that doomsday arrives - oops? did I spoil anything? - it\\'s a mere afterthought to a poorly digested potpourri of religious fanaticism and spiritual sci-fi. Thus, it also confirms my impression upon viewing the \"The Blair Witch Project\", namely, that its strength comes from its fraudulent direction, since, there was no direction at all. Unfortunately, for S\\xc3\\xa1nchez and Myrick that means that they will be forever condemned to have directed only one great movie, which is great only because it pretends not to have been directed at all. That might turn out to be the true curse of the Blair Witch.',\n",
              " b'Spoilers? Maybe a few details, but nothing too plot related. Not like it would matter with this movie. <br /><br />Air Rage blatantly rips off the mid-air infiltration premise of Executive Decision. Ice-T leads a team of four \"elite\" commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics (similar to what 3rd graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground) lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire. <br /><br />What entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look-alike has-been actors. You\\'ll immediately recognize Cyril O\\'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked, though it was so long ago that you probably won\\'t be able to place it (it was Porky\\'s). Here Cyril plays a decent knock-off of a Bill Paxton character. Most Hilarious is porker Gil Gerard, who\\'s so fat that you will never recognize him as TV\\'s Buck Rogers. Instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past, Gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona, which was clearly imagineered for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid look-alike performance as a Chuck Connors/Kirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T\\'s acting has deteriorated remarkably. It\\'s not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized. <br /><br />One of the items that plays into this movie is a CD-ROM of classified information. It\\'s being hand carried, and it\\'s apparently and unbelievably not encrypted, despite the security-savvy aura of Gerard\\'s NSA character. What a joke. I\\'m severely doubting that the information purported to be on the CD would ever even all be assembled into a portable format. <br /><br />Despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers, the gunfire is about as loud as canned air, and causes nary a person to flinch, so apparently no foley budget. The assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny. The flight attendant\\'s use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. When she takes intuitively to the mini-Uzi pistol, which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever, that\\'s just too stupid. A true elite team would carry MP-5s for this type thing or maybe SOCOMM .45s, or even customized Hi- Powers if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school... The lame-o standard issue 92Fs are totally unbelievable, having lost most of their cool after Lethal Weapon I. The bad guys, supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types, have an assorted mixture of absurdity, like the aforementioned mini-Uzi pistol and a Tec-9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extender that isn\\'t a silencer. <br /><br />There was one touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other reviewers: The flight attendant and Ice-T did lower the craft to 10,000 feet for \"breathable air\" before they opened the door. And I also got the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to get the door closed, that she basically just gave up on that point. As far as the landing, there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown. Sigh. <br /><br />Only the Dukes of Hazard eluding Roscoe P. Coltrane at the \"pass\" could shame this movie for use of stock footage. They obviously chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they couldn\\'t get stock of an F-117. Aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001, let\\'s also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B-2, and that at point blank range... Well, I\\'m no expert, but I\\'m having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on Radar. <br /><br />As others have pointed out, the repeated references to \"F-15s\" when they were showing F -16s was laughable. Details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with, not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. <br /><br />Wow. What a show. Catch it on Stars or something. Don\\'t pay to rent it, but do watch it for laughs. In contention for worst movie ever, right up there with No Holds Barred, which at least had some originality.',\n",

Maria Galana who plays an old woman in the sixties from a village in South Spain. Her four sons have moved away as soon as they could to the north.<br /><br />Her husband is admitted to one hospital in the city where she finds herself a bit out of place. Her daughter lives in the same city whom her husband hates as she has gone beyond the cultural limitations and has studied.

He meets a beautiful native girl named Tito (Dorothy Janis), half white and half native like himself.

The natives begin to have a love affair much to the chagrin of the wealthy benefactor and a prostitute (Ren\\xc3\\xa9e Ador\\xc3\\xa9e) who is in love with Novarro.<br /><br />As a silent made after the talkies swept entertainment, this film features a recorded soundtrack with sung music and sound effects. Sometimes the lips do not match the recording, but the track works quite well with illustrating the story.\",\n",
              " b'In preparation for this movie, the writers underwent a serious process. The writers went into a room and armed themselves with a jar full of movie clich\\xc3\\xa9s. They pulled out one after another. \"Military man wants action that could endanger the world.\" \"Sappy love story between two main characters\" \"Scientist realizes his experiments have condemned the world to doom.\" \"Heroes find a way to fight dire problem with help of a coincidence.\" I swear, this movie was made by Trey Parker of South Park fame. Watch the episode Die, Hippy Die, and this film eerily mimics that overly clich\\xc3\\xa9d plot line. A small difference, however-South Park is meant to parody. This film was also a testament to how badly Lucy Lawless needs work. My god, Xena, how the mighty have fallen. One positive, however, is that this film really made me and my friends laugh like crazy. If you still want to see it, go into it thinking of it as a comedy. Believe me, it\\'s much better that way.',\n",
              " b'I saw this movie as a child, and had a chance to see it recently after more years than I want to admit. I know why it has stuck with me for so many years. This is powerful stuff, even by today\\'s standards. Crime, punishment, yellow journalism, it is all addressed in this finely acted, fast paced drama. Bridges(like you\\'ve never seen him before!)turns in an acting \\'tour de force\\' as the ego-maniac, demented hoodlum that kills without reason. Lovejoy is the husband and father caught up in a bad period of economics, Carlson the reporter that must learn that the power of the word is often as swift and deadly as that of the sword. This is high drama, done in the classic 50s film-noir tradition, it is must viewing for anyone that enjoyed \"In Cold Blood\"(1967)and movies of that genre.',\n",
              " b'I first saw this film 5 years ago as a University student when it originally came out. I still remember how impressed I was afterward. I told my sister who was with me at the time, \"I think that is the BEST Bollywood film I have seen so far\". I recently saw this film again, and I remembered again why I loved it SO much the first time. This movie is a credit to Farhan Akhtar who has since directed the spectacular movie \"Lakshya\".He is a true talent to contend with in Bollywood,and certain more experienced directors, can take a leaf off his book. <br /><br />\"Dil Chata Hain\" works on SO many levels. It\\'s an attempt at telling a mature story. NOT the same old plot exhausted to death, and no \"over blown\" Bhangra numbers either! The movie was content and script driven. It explores the many faces of love, and the changes that occur in friendships as people mature and move on with life. But what it shows also is that true friendship can overcome many an adversity, misunderstanding, and even time.The first movie about \"Male-bonding\" to come out of Bollywood!<br /><br />So beautifully told, this story captures the lives and loves of Akash, Sameer and Sidhart (Sid). Played brilliantly by Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Akshay Khanna.They are supported by Dimple Kapadia, Preity Zinta & Sonali Kulkarni. All the main actors give their best in this movie, and I cannot say one thing negative about any of their performances. (Except maybe that Sonali didn\\'t have enough to do). The movie also includes a few characters that have only a few scenes to play but they play them well, and they ALL add value to the story. <br /><br />This movie was the turning point in Saif\\'s career. Since DCH, he has gone from strength to strength, and his versatility as an actor has finally been recognized. As for Aamir Khan... what can I say? His performances are always stellar,as he is a \"thinking\" actor who gives his all to a character he plays.I have yet to see a \"bad performance\" given by Aamir. He never does things by half. Akshay is great and he too has always given fine performances in all his movies to date! Preity and Dimple play the next most prominent characters in the movie. Preity gave a very controlled performance, and Dimple was superb. She gave this movie that extra bit of \"Oommf\". I also love the way the story did not portray a clich\\xc3\\xa9d relationship between an older women, and younger man, and how they kept both the characters dignity in tact. <br /><br />The Akash-Shalini love story was touching too,as these are two people who never intended to fall in love with each other,but did.Akash,who does not believe in love, and Shalini, who is engaged to her surrogate parent\\'s son.The scene in which her father tells Akash, \"please look after her, as she is my daughter\" was very emotional.But the best part was that it was not \"over-dramatized\".The emotions of the moment created it\\'s own drama. <br /><br />All in all, this was a \"coming of age\" story.In the end, we see the three characters two years later, in the same place in Goa where they spend that last summer of youth together.At this point though,they have come full circle, and have moved on from \"boys to men\".We feel their maturity come through as they sit their talking,even though non of them say anything profound. <br /><br />In conclusion,all I can say is PLEASE make more intelligent and enlightening movies like this one!<br /><br />Farhan,very well done indeed!All the best!',\n",
              " b'Another film based on a story by AAV Creative Unit This movie walks that fine line between being \"one of the absolutely worst films ever made\" and \"one of the absolutely worst films ever made, yet somehow entertaining\". Its a line it crosses and re-crosses frequently with in its 90 minute running time making for a surreal experience. (And don\\'t get me wrong this movie is BAD, but its occasionally as low as you can go in badness and still be enjoyable in a jaw dropping sort of way.) The plot of this film has a witch queen sending off a rubber suited monster thats controlled by a guy playing a magic flute off to kill people while the cops try to stop the mayhem. Meanwhile in unrelated footage Richard Harrison runs around trying to look like he\\'s part of the movie after a girl he picks up on the side of the road (after she flashes him her breasts) dies spewing orange ooze after a failed murder attempt during sex. I wish I was making this up.<br /><br />Dreadful, this is a movie that will tax even the most jaded bad movie lover.

              " b'Hercules Unchained picks up right where Hercules (1958) left off. Hercules and his new bride, Iole, are headed to Thebes. A fight for the throne between two brothers puts a kink in Hercules\\' plans, so he decides to act as peacemaker. But before he can carry out his mission, he mistakenly drinks from the \"waters of forgetfulness\" and is taken prisoner by Queen Omphale. Unsure of his real identity, Hercules is at the Queen\\'s mercy and is reduced to being her plaything. Meanwhile, Iole is caught between the warring brothers and faces death. Can Hercules come to his senses in time to save his wife and his beloved Thebes? <br /><br />Hercules Unchained is one of those instances where I find the sequel superior to the original. First off, the movie is just more interesting. The original Hercules had a tendency to drag. While Hercules Unchained isn\\'t a thrill-a-minute, there is certainly more action. Second, I think everyone involved from the actors to the director seemed more comfortable in their respective roles in the sequel. That\\'s only natural. Finally, and probably most importantly, Mario Bava\\'s influence is more pronounced and evident in Hercules Unchained. There are instances throughout the movie that show his touch. For example, when Hercules meets the old king in the cave, the use of colored gel lighting in the scene simply screams Bava. Take a look at that scene and compare it with what Bava would do in his on Hercules movie, Hercules in the Haunted World, and see if you don\\'t agree.<br /><br />A lot of different muscle-bound actors would play the role of Hercules in these Italian productions, but none would do it any better that Steve Reeves. In this instance, the original is still the best. Others cast in the role may have been better actors and some may have been more gifted physically, but few could combine the two into a single package as effectively as Reeves.<br /><br />I realize that these Italian sword and sandal movies may not be for everyone, but I really get a kick out of most of them. For anyone new to these movies, Hercules Unchained would make an excellent jumping off point.',\n",

The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some, but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes, disturbs, and haunts with the question: What does an evil person look like?<br /><br />Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily... forgotten.',\n",

It looked like it might be good from the box, but I must say again: nothing about this movie even resembled good.

The actors seem to be trying, but with a script this horrible, Marlon Brando himself (and I'm talking old school Brando, not The Island of Dr. Moreau Brando here) would've come off amateurish.

              " b'The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /><br />Like \"The Man From Planet X,\" this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing. Meaning, we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction. And yes, it\\'s another \"classic\" released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound--by Midnite Movies.<br /><br />So, the main reason to watch this film? Oh, it\\'s definitely the whole time our space crew is on Mars. (What, you thought \"Angry Red Planet\" referred to Neptune?) Prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship, inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the \"puny female\" member of the crew. It\\'d be somewhat offensive by today\\'s standards if it weren\\'t so damn funny. But Mars is the real reason we\\'re watching this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars is screaming bloody red. It\\'s filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness. It\\'s really quite a sight\\xc2\\x97as are the (ha ha) aliens viewers are to witness. The best being the \"ratbatspidercrab.\" You think that\\'s a joke? That\\'s what they call it in the movie! It\\'s a gigantic chimera (small puppet) of a thing combining traits of rats, bats, spiders, and crabs.

              " b\"I will be starting this review by saying that this is an EXCELLENT movie.<br /><br />Miike, THE Auteur of the 21st century, is producing films at such an alarming rate that its almost impossible to keep up with the man. Yet he manages to keep producing films of an extremely high standard AND creating different and interesting techniques. Izo is another fine example of this.<br /><br />The broken structure is far more complex than Nolan's 'Memento' and far more effective as it allows you to experience the agony that Izo is constantly feeling.<br /><br />The constant metaphors that keep popping up throughout the non-stop carnage bring more layers to the film than any 'shock' movie yet Miike still manages to throw in a few gallons of blood and a very interesting place to hide a sword (ladies) for good measure.<br /><br />So in summary a very poignant anti-war piece with some fine visual styles and some very brutal action. And a great guitarist.<br /><br />Go see. And take the whole family. <br /><br />Cinema at its best.\",\n",

              " b'Fann Wong (Yes, weird name) . Just because some industry bigwig thought she was photogenic and popular with teenagers, she was cast in this picture. Peter Ho is a singer by trade and this is his first time acting. Though they look like they could sell toothpaste together, they certainly can\\'t sell movies. This movie was a thorough waste of time and it nearly bored me to tears in the cinema.<br /><br />\"The truth about Jane and Sam\" is a totally shallow work employing the oldest plot in the book. A cynical, jaded woman (Fann Wong) in Hong Kong, meets Singaporean journalist(Peter Ho). At first they don\\'t like one another, then he finds she is actually a sweet, nice girl inside. Then they end up going to bed. The next morning, POW! she is in the kitchen (how domestic) , making him breakfast.<br /><br />This is just a movie to cheat impressional teenagers of their allowances. By the way, the soundtrack sucks too. Thank goodness they didn\\'t let Fann Wong sing the theme song. . Watch this movie at your own peril.',\n",

He\\'s the best thing about this film...sinister, self-serving, and cold-blooded.

              " b'I saw this film last night at the Midwest Indy Film Fest in Chicago. I commend the filmmakers on a beautiful and challenging story and wonderful execution. I strongly disagreed with the length and labored approach in the final edit. I agree with the director that languor and easy films are needed in our fast pace world, yet, here the length is doing your film a disservice. The film lover next to me fell asleep! I struggled to keep interested.<br /><br />As filmmakers you need to take a stand with your beliefs, but you need to realize the risks. Does this particular film need to be 39 minutes, 37, 22? Is that worth endearing the film to this part of the audience, while, this part of the audience falls asleep? I bring this up because I feel the film will lose nothing, and gain so much more, if it was tighter. The idea that you need a labored approach for this heavy theme is not a valid argument. Roman Polanski\\'s \"Two Men and a Wardrobe\" is soaked with rich themes and is 15 minutes. Marcell Ivanyi\\'s \"Wind\" is spell binding in the themes it introduces at 6 minutes.<br /><br />Ultimately, the short film is a unique artform, complex and ever changing. There is a certain social contract that exists between filmmaker and audience on what that artform is. What is the general public perception on the range of length of the short film artform? Do you feel the labored edit of your story is justified by the power of the third act and the direction of the characters arc? Why do some people enjoy the pace of \"Lost in Translation\" but fall asleep here? You can break those conditions whenever you like, and I hope you do, just recognize the risk.<br /><br />To end on a good note, I like your effort now; I\\'ll love your film after a tighter edit.',\n",

              " b\"London to Brighton is a superb slice of British crime pulp; a no nonsense, down and dirty tale of two relatively weak individuals, given the parameters of the genre, desperate to get away from the lifestyle they've grim-and-bared up until this point. Systematically, one particular character must balance evading capture with the taking on of the moral responsibilities that come with looking after a much younger individual they've unwittingly roped into this world by way of child-prostitution. If there is a distinct shrill ringing throughout us as the film plays out, it's because while conforming to gangster genre conventions, we see most of the world and most of the film unfold through the eyes and ultimately with two females: a very young girl and a middle aged woman, two people we feel are under threat and will have harm come to them if they're caught. This is in stark contrast to usual crime film fare; in which crime infused males can be on the run, or can owe a debt, or whatever \\xc2\\x96 but do not necessarily carry the same vulnerability. Thus, London to Brighton, with its scuzzy and raw feel, comes across as scarier; more frightening in its depiction of a world, the characters within and overall attention to genre.<br /><br />The girls on the run are twelve year old Joanne (Groome) and the much elder Kelly (Stanley), a prostitute. They're played by two actresses more familiar to televisual work and as low-down supporting roles in feature films, but here are given the chance to shine in lead roles, snapping up the opportunity in the process. Their predicament is a set up that can be pitched in little to no words, immediately getting across a sense of urgency. The film begins with the two in a public toilet; panic-stricken and acting in nervous manner; something's gone wrong and they're about to go on the run from a London based crime syndicate as those connected to the organisation chase them.<br /><br />The film gets across a sense of the sort of danger they're in without ever really showing anything, instead opting for the talk of an off screen event or individual. On this occasion, the talk of potentially of going to prison for what it is they've done is most prominent an item of which plants seeds of great worry in our minds as we observe these relatively hapless, physically out of breath with their clothes torn and clearly in a bad shape, people stumble through the seamy, low-level based locations they inhabit. The introduction of Derek (Harris), Kelly's pimp, and the potential threat that he carries as a character is only brought into perspective when it is revealed he answers further still to an individual higher up than he is; the son of the leader of this organisation. Where Derek is more extroverted and animated; Stuart (Spruell), the higher up, is calmer, dresses more formally and talks in a quieter manner which quickly pushes the boundaries out further as to whom acts as more of a threat, without taking away any of the initial menace Derek inhabits. This minute, but observed ploy, captures the film's tone of getting in deeper; of assuming something to be of a specific nature but then having to recognise a new threat, or new predicament, which furthers feelings and emotions.<br /><br />As an event which spawns the mess everyone finds themselves in, it is revealed that Joanne is a runaway wondering the streets of London, and is quickly picked up by both Derek and Kelly when it is made apparent a local crime boss, Stuart's father, wants a younger girl to feed some depraved sexual cravings. Joanne carries with her a mouth, an ability to small talk her way through conversations with adults that we truly feel she might actually possess. The locale in which she is required for whatever perverted plans are in store for her is presented by way of brilliant, white light; a blinding light that reflects off of seemingly marble walls; floors and white pillars dotted around the room. The mise-en-scene and colour gives it a disturbing sense of resembling ancient Rome, specifically in appearance; in all its rich, beautiful, robe-decked in-glory. The sheer contrast of locales between what we're presented through the cities of London and Brighton, the latter of which itself looked like a sunny; beach-housing; amusements displaying safe haven compared to London, is stark, disorientating and disturbing.<br /><br />The film really is fine feature debut, amongst the best of last decade and sits alongside works such as Donnie Darko; One Hour Photo and Memento. There's a real sense of terror in London to Brighton; an immediacy which you feel is born out of the two female leads and their place in the film working within a genre which would usually, in terms of Kelly's role as a prostitute, see them relegated to a nothing supporting role or to act as mere eye candy. Its willingness to have its women act in an independent and strong manner sees them break away from orders in a very male dominated world, that of crime, and renders them characters whom have limits; morals and know that when the line is to be drawn, it must be drawn, no matter what the consequence or whom one is dealing with. London to Brighton forms an exciting passage of film-making out of a relatively routine idea, with guided attention toward mostly all of the characters, Stuart of which goes through his own series of frightening changes later on; awareness of how the film should 'look' at very specific points and gets the best out of a low-key cast. Director Paul Williams has triumphed.\",\n",
              " b\"Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.\",\n",
              " b'\"Pressure Point\" qualifies as just another formulaic hostage thriller that suffers from comatose direction. Jed Griffin (Michael Madison of \"Reservoir Dogs\") is taking his family\\xc2\\x97wife, teenage son, and tweener daughter\\xc2\\x97on a long overdue vacation into Vermont to ski. Meanwhile, ex-con Rudy Wicker (Jeff Wincott of \"S.W.A.T.) and his partner plan to rob a bank and make a clean getaway in a plane over the border into Canada. However, everything goes wrong when they hold up a small-town bank. First, Sheriff Bingham Hunt (Steve Adams of \"The Bone Collector\\') mortally wounds the driver of the getaway, and the vehicle careens out of control and smashes into Hunt\\'s wife Tracy (Claudia Bess of \"Strip Search\") as she is trying to give him his personal radio. Rudy gets off with what appears to be a flesh wound and races out of town. No sooner has he left the city limits than another sheriff\\'s deputy blue-lights him. When the deputy approaches the car, Rudy jumps out and guns him down, then ices his partner, and commandeers the sheriff\\'s cruiser. The grief-stricken Hunt sets out to capture and kill Rudy, but Rudy outsmarts him and hijacks Jed and his family while the protagonist is making small repairs to his 1979 motor home. Rudy gets tire of Jed\\'s sass, shoots him, and leaves him for dead on the roadside. Earlier, after Rudy shot the sheriff\\'s deputy, he not only stole his cruiser but also his jacket. Now, Rudy leaves the sheriff\\'s jacket with Jed and takes off with Jed\\'s family as his hostage. Rudy is bound and determined to reach his rendezvous point with the plane so he can get out of the country. As it turns out, when Rudy shot Jed, Rudy\\'s bullet lodged in Jed\\'s cell phone and Jed resolves to catch up to Rudy. The problem is that Jed doesn\\'t know that Sheriff Hunt is determined to kill Rudy. Moreover, when Jed tries to flag Hunt down, the sheriff sees the jacket taken off his murdered deputy and shoots first before he can confirm Jed\\'s story. Director Eric Weston juxtaposes scenes of the sheriff\\'s manhunt, Jed\\'s efforts to rescue his family, and Rudy\\'s desperate efforts to get away with the loot. Unfortunately, juxtaposing these three characters and their objectives generates no suspense. The cliff-hanger conclusion doesn\\'t add much to this paint-by-the-number nonsense. Clearly, Madison needed a paycheck. In fact, we learn nothing about Madison\\'s character because the scenarists provide him with no backstory. As this generation\\'s Robert Mitchum, Madison has great presence but he makes no impression on this second-rate actioneer. Martial arts expert Jeff Wincott adopts a different look, but his vicious killer is a nit-wit. Michelle Scarabelli effectively plays one of Hunt\\'s level-headed deputies who ensures that her hysteria-riddled sheriff doesn\\'t kill the wrong man. \"Pressure Point\" lacks pressure from start to finish and makes no point other than to burn time.',\n",

              " b'Saw this piece of work at a film fest in CA. My god, what was the director thinking? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when making a short film. First off, this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The film takes place partially in \"The Waystation\", some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really takes place.<br /><br />THe acting is beyond bad. So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. The lead actress Julia Reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films. There is one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner but it\\'s like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue, which bordered on absurd. The writer (whom I assume is also the director) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain.<br /><br />The overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest, with a film this bad it\\'s easy to overlook it. The production design is pretty good, although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. The costumes and make-up are okay, and I understand the production was working with a low budget. It\\'s just when the characters speak, or they try and push the plot forward, the film unravels into a muck of crap.<br /><br />As I\\'ve said, this film is god awful. It\\'s like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this. My only hope is that he used other people\\'s money on this, because if he used his own, he\\'s a total sucker.',\n",
              " b'Film sequels were a novelty in 1925, when DON Q, SON OF ZORRO marked a big profit for United Artists. Then and now, it is considered to be a better film than the original, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1920), which made star and producer Douglas Fairbanks the personification of the Swashbuckler five years earlier.<br /><br />Since his screen debut in 1915, Fairbanks had always been cast in contemporary comedies as a fun-loving, never-say-die, go-getter who gets the girl and catches the bad guys \\xc2\\x96 all the while exhibiting his athletic prowess and bravado. He was a major film actor, but his popularity was beginning to wane due to the monotony of his roles and vehicles. <br /><br />The formation of United Artists Corporation in 1919 gave founders Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith control over their own projects. Fairbanks chose this opportunity to risk reinventing his image by starring in this film adaptation of The Curse of Capistrano. The serialized novel written by Johnston McCulley had been published that year in a popular pulp magazine. It introduced the character of Zorro to the world. The magic of the movie assured Zorro\\'s place among fictional super-heroes. The character lived on in several more film versions as well as books, comics, cartoons, Halloween costumes, toys, and in the popular 1950\\'s television series starring Guy Williams.<br /><br />In THE MARK OF ZORRO, set in early 19th century California, Fairbanks came up with an ingenious concept \\xc2\\x96 showcasing his likable contemporary stock character into an action/adventure period costume picture. He plays Don Diego Vega, the milksop son of an affluent rancher who, like the Scarlet Pimpernel, dons a disguise to defend the impoverished townsfolk from the tyrants in power. His alter ego Zorro\\'s, (Spanish for fox) trademarks are the black cape and cowl mask he wears and the master swordsmanship he displays. He is known to brand his victims with a \"Z\" made with three fast strokes of his blade. At the end of the film, after Zorro\\'s greatest triumph, his identity is revealed. He throws his sword into the air. It lodges into a high spot on the wall, as Zorro shouts, \"Till I need you again!\" Though it was probably not Fairbanks\\' intention at the time, this line was a prime set-up for a sequel if there ever was one. <br /><br />After the tremendous financial and critical success of ZORRO, Fairbanks continued to give the public what it wanted \\xc2\\x96 the charismatic Fairbanks persona in lavish period epics. THE THREE MUSKETEERS, ROBIN HOOD and THE THIEF OF BAGDAD were all released in the years between the two Zorro epics.<br /><br />As one can easily discern by the title of this follow-up, Doug is back as Diego\\'s son - namely Don Cesar, aka \"Don Q.\" The screenplay is based on the novel \"Don Q\\'s Love Story\" by Hesketh Prichard and Kate Prichard which had no relationship to Zorro at all. But by making Don Q the offspring of the famous hero, it cashed in on the audience\\'s familiarity with the original and made it possible for Doug to play a dual role as both father and son.<br /><br />In the family tradition, Don Cesar is sent to Spain to continue his education and learn the traditions of his ancestors. His high-spirited ways and showmanship with a bullwhip make him a favorite of the Queen\\'s cousin, Archduke Paul of Austria (Warner Oland). Cesar also makes an enemy of surly Don Sebastian (Donald Crisp), a member of the Queen\\'s guard, and both men fall for the beautiful Dolores de Muro (Mary Astor). After Cesar is framed for murder, he fakes suicide and goes underground until he can prove the guilt of the real killer. Meanwhile, in California, Don Diego receives word of his son\\'s predicament. He retrieves his sword from where it had stuck thirty years before, digs out his mask and cape and travels to Spain to help rescue his son. Father and son take on 15 soldiers in a sword fight during the film\\'s exuberant finale. <br /><br />Audiences and critics alike loved DON Q even more than the original. Film-making technique and technology had improved rapidly since 1920. The sequel had a stronger plot, higher production values and better pacing. What\\'s more, Fairbanks has fine-tuned his swashbuckler persona to perfection. He was never was he more cocksure, flamboyant and amusing than he appears here. Though already 41 years old, he easily got away with playing a much younger character in no small part due to his physical fitness. He is shown to great advantage, engaging in sword-play, jumping on a horse or \\xc2\\x96 his specialty in this film - cracking a whip. Well known for performing his own stunts, Doug reportedly spent six weeks learning fancy whipmanship. He uses it to light a cigarette, extinguish a candle, slice paper, lasso a bull and swing onto a balcony. He also shows himself to be a dandy on the dance floor in a parody of a Valentino tango.<br /><br />Donald Crisp, best known for his chilling performance as Lillian Gish\\'s cruel father in BROKEN BLOSSOMS, does double duty in DON Q as both co-star and director. He plays Fairbanks\\' dastardly nemesis Don Sebastian while directing one of his best films. Crisp directed more than 70 films, including the Buster Keaton classic,THE NAVIGATOR. He got his start in the movies in 1908 with the Biograph Company and appeared on screen for the last time 55 years later as Grandpa Spencer in the 1963 film SPENCER\\'S MOUNTAIN that starred Henry Fonda. Crisp died in 1974. <br /><br />The New York Times thought so highly of DON Q, SON OF ZORRO, that they named it one the 10 best films of 1925.<br /><br />While enjoyable on TV or home video, the movie is twice the fun when watched with live accompaniment and an audience as I was fortunate to experience at Cinevent 2006.',\n",

              " b'I have no idea what on earth, or beyond, could have possibly made Sam Mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, I see no reason why it should not be at #1 on the Bottom 100. For although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (#5 at the time of this publication), I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound, because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made. By contrast, everything, and I do mean everything, in this film is completely unprofessional.<br /><br />The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Right\\'s supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays. And I do emphasize \"intended.\" Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar. Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple\\'s struggle against a society that largely opposes them, it creates tired, crass stereotypes of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, the namesake couple, are portrayed as two crude, sex-starved, and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so. This meets with the opposition of Ben\\'s brother Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians (as this movie would have us believe), is loud, prying, stupid, and violent. He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think that\\'s dreadful (it is), you haven\\'t seen it all.<br /><br />The actors (?) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video. But not even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker, for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie. Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote. For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother\\'s homosexuality. But instead of portraying this idea clearly, he spits out the stupid, utterly confusing, whiny-sounding line, \"You know what, I\\'m never going to have any nieces or nephews, okay, because you\\'re so F***ED UP!\"<br /><br />Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values. Yes, I know this ain\\'t The Dark Knight, but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing. For example, six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds. People do not teleport across a room between takes. And objects do not fall FORWARD when shot! <br /><br />Do not waste your money on Ben & Arthur. I don\\'t care if you\\'re 7, 17, or 107. I don\\'t care if you\\'re gay, straight, bi, or undecided. I don\\'t care if you\\'re \"just curious.\" I don\\'t care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung-heap. Stay away, far away. This movie\\'s only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a Frisbee.',\n",

Director Casper Andreas, who also had a hand in the script, hopes to titillate and shock his target audience with bitchy, outr\\xc3\\xa9 dialogue and flashes of naked behinds; unfortunately, this isn't anything any filmmaker treading in queer-cinema waters hasn't tried before. The acting is so wooden, with casting choices apparently made on who had the best pecs, that one can only scoff at these smarmy returns. This is just the thing to kill off the gay comedy-drama. It shows no imagination, no sensitivity, no subtext, no sense of satire or self-parody. When a gay couple squabbles and breaks up for the night, it's merely for the most basic and childish reasons.

              " b\"This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once.

Having met the real-life person the movie portrays, I was also interested in how interesting this man\\'s younger life would be. Serving a mission for the Church is a rather common experience - what would make this man\\'s mission interesting? And would any non-Mormon be interested?<br /><br />I was surprised at how interesting it was to me, but wondered how interesting it would be for non-Mormons. The story, although in a Mormon setting, was a very human story with several surprises, moments of courage, demonstrations of testing personal commitment against temptation, and an endearing love story. I loved the actors - from the main stars to the peripherals, it was high quality all around.<br /><br />Throughout the film I kept asking myself: how would I have acted in this situation? I have to admit, this story portrays a life to emulate. It was personally inspiring.<br /><br />This film is not filled with sex or violence or gore; it\\'s simply a good story well-told. I would give it 8 out of 10.',\n",

Therefore watching a horror film, I primarily want to be scared. The Grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. I've been a horror film fan for many years, and I'm talking about the masters such as Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days. If you want to be scared, watch this film. Way scarier than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also think is a great film).\",\n",

The fact that all the furniture, the flowers and other things are alive and have faces, it makes this show all the more entertaining and weird. The rest of my family love this too, especially my mum, I think it's her favourite children's TV series! :O I think people who didn't like this are missing something and just focus a little too much on the not-so-good points of things.

              " b\"<br /><br />This is probably one of the best sonic games I have ever played! I can tell you right now that this unlike almost all Sonic The Hedgehog games for various reasons. First off, this game was not really meant for kids for various different reasons. For starters, some of the comments made in the game are not ones I would think younger kids would understand. Also, the plot was very complicated for younger kids. Another thing, Rouge The Bat tore away from all Sonic games, making it very obvious that the creator had intended it to be for fans now who were fans from the very begining. Some of the biggest fans are from 15-25, so that's where I'm guessing Rouge came from. Rouge is a sexy, sassy. .Bat that uses looks and more to get her way. Not only that, but a costume she aquires later is a very. .SHOWY costume! I also must say that the ending game was most likely NOT meant for kids. Let's put it this way, so I don't give anything away, Dr. Gerald Robotnik makes his little speech, then people in the background start screaming things that would familiar to older audiences.<br /><br />Anyway, enough with why the game was not really meant for kids. Let's move onto the good additions to the game! I must say, I was really impressed with the graphics in this game! Everything was full of detail, down the very last leaf on a tree! In fact, most of the game was almost in completely rendered 3-D. Unfortunately, there weren't as many cool cut scenes like Sonic Adventure had with perfect, realistic animation. Another great thing about this game was the music. Every characters level had the same type of music, that was VERY well organized. Sonic gets regular rock music, Tails gets some sort of hippie music, Knuckles gets really great hip hop music, Shadow gets total techno feed music, Eggman gets techno mixed in with heavy metal, and Rouge gets very catchy jazz music. I must say that Rouge's music was so catchy that I walk around humming her music. Another great addition to this game were the characters Shadow and Rouge, which were awesome characters! I really hope that Shadow ends up getting his own video game series after this. Rouge was great, but she could have been better. Sure she could hunt better than Knuckles and run faster than Sonic, but being a bat, she still couldn't walk on ceilings or use any supersonic waves that bats would use. Plus, a glitch about the game, is that she flies in cut scenes, yet she can only glide when you play as her. However, she WAS a great addition to the game, and I would love to see her come back!<br /><br />Well, in general, Sonic Adventure 2 is probably one of the best games I have played in a long time, and I look forward to Sonic Adventure 3 on the GameCube by Nintendo!\",\n",

The actors I expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point).

              " b\"(possible spoilers)<br /><br />Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us.<br /><br />The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are undermined<br /><br />somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much better<br /><br />use of a high budget) turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger<br /><br />(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).<br /><br />The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensively<br /><br />hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising<br /><br />campaign.<br /><br />The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). She<br /><br />seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.<br /><br />Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their<br /><br />stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,<br /><br />manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today. Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!\",\n",

I found nothing funny about the situation of Georgia. It\\'s rather tragic. After you\\'ve lived in a system in which you may have paid 40 dollars for rent, 5 for telephone or 10 for electricity, it becomes completely absurd when your bills take most of your salary, as in the Capitalist society most of us live in, to pay for the wealth of the Earth that belongs to every single soul on this planet. The sudden presence of a transnational company (that is ruthless, no matter if its officials claim the opposite) in those countries, where political corruption, greed and totalitarian methods helped to mine its social and economic system, has very little to laugh about. On top of that, foreign official in Georgia Pier Lewis, who constantly makes fun of the company\\'s methods (as cutting power for a few minutes in an airport for not paying its bills, when a plane was about to land) and the Georgian people\\'s reactions, is a rather pathetic character, making one wonder if he\\'s ever heard the word humanism. 2/10.',\n",

I can see the pitch saying, here is the script I doesn't make sense now but we will work on it in post. Yeah it didn't happen. Please do not bother this terrible drivel. Worse than anything is that it actually looks pretty decent, but it just goes to show if you don't have a decent script that makes at least A LITTLE bit of sense it won't matter. That acting is wooden & somebody thought they were making something good, because it seems like there was some care in the making of it.

This movie has stood the test of times.<br /><br />Om Puri gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment. This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society.<br /><br />This is the story of a cop (Om Puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai cops. Kudos to Nihalani !! <br /><br />After this movie a slew of Bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus. Thus this movie was truly a trend setter. This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade. <br /><br />This movie was a moderate box office hit. <br /><br />A must-see for discerning movie fans.',\n",

On the cover are two people (who are not in the movie) in ski gear (which is never seen) looking up at a pink model of the Starship Enterprise (do I *really* need to comment on this?).<br /><br />The movie is a slogging morass of nonacting that has no real plot, coherence, or semblance of intelligence. Not quite as action-packed as _Manos: The Hands of Fate_, the movie centers around a group of people in a remote cabin who don't know what to do when they get word of some sort of plague (FX supplied by Red Devil red smokeballs) striking the rest of the planet. oddly, the rest of the planet deals with this plague with an odd sort of indifference, punctuated by people running down a street with smoke pots going off around them.<br /><br />Stuck in the cabin, the people wonder what to do, talk to a mysterious voice on the radio, and disappear one by one. At last, two remain, and stagger into the now-abandoned snow-covered town, and are replaced by two scantily-clad children walking through a spring field.<br /><br />Now you know what the movie's about, there's no need to suffer through it.\",\n",

Imagine how many similar concoctions never reached this stage, or took place without being filmed. The patience of editor Howard Smith for reviewing so many sources is being rewarded here. Some of the ideas inspired (or were inspired by) scenes in contemporary Hollywood movies, i.e., the building climbing, or survive as photo post cards. What we see here was a sampling of unusual and compulsive behavior popular in the film age. A question: was the TV presenter the young David Letterman?\",\n",
              " b\"One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's, Scarface is very much a film of its time. The first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you, 'made in 1983'. The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. This is still a superb film. While Georgio Moroder's music has dated a fair bit, it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma, one of two films that he has made with Pacino (the other being the fantastic Carlito's Way). All of De Palma's trademarks are here; the strong language, the graphic violence (more on that later), the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work.<br /><br />Pacino dominates the film and I mean that literally. He is the dominant star of this film. His performance over the top, this is one of those films were Pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them, this time with a superb Cuban accent. However, this is Pacino and he does it fantastically. Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact. While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all, this is an excessive film. Take a look at the production design of Tony's house, take a look at the violence in this film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films. Take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so Pacino's performance I suppose is perfect for the film. He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way. Steven Bauer, in particularly, as Manny, Tony's best friend, is the stand out of the supporting cast. His performance is so controlled and quiet in a De Niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn. Michelle Pfeiffer, of course, adds the glamor, Robert Loggia adds gravitas as usual and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great debut as Tony's sister.<br /><br />Of course this is more than just a film about excess. There is more to it than drugs, violence, chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out. This is a film about the darker side of the American dream. In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films. Tony finds himself coming to America, getting it all, living the American dream and then losing it all in violent fashion, and by saying he loses it all, I mean he loses it all. He kills his best friend, his sister is killed, his empire crumbles, literally, around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion, bullets ripping through him. <br /><br />Without doubt Scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's. Sure, it doesn't have the subtleties of The Godfather films, but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again.\",\n",
              " b'It\\'s a little disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie...played by Gig Young. But this film is where Gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name.<br /><br />I\\'m going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that I really enjoyed this film, mainly because of the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring, and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during Woar War I. <br /><br />As the \"man\" of the house, Fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father\\'s will which would therefore allow a Donald Trump type named Charles Barclay to get the family home.

              " b'Recently I was looking for the newly issued Wide Screen DVD of FLY AWAY HOME and came upon interesting title that I had never heard of: GREY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough Film caught my attention (he responsible for such fine films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN, and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the screenplay was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This \"Special Edition\" was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under $10.00 -- so I chanced it & bought it. WOW! What a beautiful film. Pierce Brosnan stars as Archie Grey Owl, a real life trapper in the 1930s, who came to love and respect the wild lands of Canada, and worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond film) gives a shaded, warm, powerful performance as does Annie Galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land -- especially the beaver. A fine score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photograhy by Roger Pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film. AND the extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real Grey Owl as well as audio commentary tracks by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine additions PLUS options for those having access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GREY OWL has been released directly to DVD in the United States -- a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood\\'s lack of interest in distributing something that isn\\'t loaded with a lot of violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion -- and a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GREY OWL is a very fine film -- worth checking out! This is one I look forward to sharing with others.',\n",
              " b'Visually stunning, as Bava\\'s work usually was, \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" offers the blueprint that would be used for all types of gory body count movies, especially the slasher craze of the late 70s & early 80s. Although he\\'d made similar films before (such as \"Blood and Black Lace\" and even \"Kill, Baby, Kill\"), never before had he been this explicit in his violence. The emphasis here was not only on the violent murders, but the bloody details.<br /><br />The rather loose plot is centered on a lovely bay belonging to a Countess. In a stunning opening, she is murdered, and then just as quickly, her murderer is murdered by an unseen third party. At stake is the ownership of the valuable bay property, and it\\'s something that a number of people would kill for. In fact, apparently everybody would kill for it. A series of gruesome murders is set in motion, each one more outlandish than the last, to the point where when a simple strangulation takes place late in the film, the viewer is shocked at the restraint.<br /><br />Bava\\'s inventive camera tricks have never been more appealing than here, not to mention the detailed color schemes he gets going. I was shocked to learn that this movie was not shot in a wooded area, as Bava has made it appear, but rather the woods were simulated by clever camera angles and random branches held in front of the camera. No matter how, he created a convincing atmosphere of isolation. From the opening scene, which takes place in a secluded mansion on a stormy night, Bava\\'s setting is both exotic and menacing. The murders are shocking enough, but even more disturbing is the way Bava lingers over the death throes of the victims in an almost pornographic way. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen anything quite so gruesome as a particular murder here that involves a character getting a machete embedded in his face. Even though it was duplicated in several other films (both \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Friday the 13th Part 2\"), never was it so gut wrenchingly realized.<br /><br />Only a few things spoil the ride here, and admittedly they are rather major. The plot is quite convoluted, so much that I gave up trying to figure out what was going on. Unlike Jason\\'s mindless rampages, these murders have multiple perpetrators and motivations driving them, not to mention the scheming and double-crossing that takes place here. Then there\\'s the conclusion, which is somewhat unsatisfying. While none of the situations are especially realistic, Bava\\'s wrap-up here is absolutely absurd and jokey, whereas the film\\'s tone was not like this until the last few moments.<br /><br />Overall though, I don\\'t care about any of that. \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" is outstanding enough to rise above it, and Bava gives us enough to go on that all I can remember is being overwhelmed by his visuals and the perverse spectacle of 13 bizarre death scenes all in one movie.',\n",
              " b\"Unless I'm sadly mistaken, I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video, I'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors, at the end of it, and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now, but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos. There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits, and they're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes. What could make a rap group look more foolish I can't imagine.<br /><br />(spoilers) At any rate, I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version, so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series. The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2, with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands. Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in, then runs to the bathroom, the sink's handles turn into Freddy's hands and attack her, and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists. From there, the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment. <br /><br />`Larry' Fishburne, tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles, was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice-guy orderly, stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little. Not surprisingly, he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie. Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor, but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film. The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists. All of them are cynical and uncooperative, almost none believing that they really belong there at all. Eventually, they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria.<br /><br />Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson, this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger. Not surprisingly, she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients, since she had experienced exactly what they're going through. There are some interesting murders in this installment, and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump. There is a gigantic, worm-like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole, there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV, but there is also an unconvincing go-motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger's skeleton, which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard. And one of the more groan-inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream (the one famous for sleepwalking), tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet. Ouch.<br /><br />We get a peek into Freddy's past in this installment. Not only do we meet his mother, but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs. In fighting Freddy, the patients all band together and, in their dreams, use their special powers (most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life) to fight him. One student, bound to a wheelchair, is able to walk in his dreams, another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the `Wizard Master,' another is `beautiful and bad' (she has lots of makeup, her hair stands up in a foot-high Mohawk, and she has knives). Clever, but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients, the one who can't speak, not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie, when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams (at just the right moment to save the day). His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long, but collectively, now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors.<br /><br />Altogether, this is not an entirely weak entry into the series. The acting is pretty shoddy, but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie. Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast, displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career, and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two \\xc2\\x96 a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films. The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension, which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil. But then again, not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed, or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives. But it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones\\xc2\\x85\",\n",
              " b\"Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon starts aboard a plane full of American high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in Japan, unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the Himalayas. Unlucky really. With some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes. However just when they think their luck couldn't get any worse they soon discover that a huge, hairy Yeti type Abominable Snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all. Trapped, cold, starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time?<br /><br />Yeah, with a title like Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the Sci-Fi Channel has made yet another 'Creature Feature' although to give these things a bit of variety the Sci-Fi Channel here in the UK are now dubbing them as a 'Beast Feast'! As if that will make any difference. Directed by Paul Ziller one has to say that Yeti: Curse of the Snow Deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time, sure it's bad but it's sort of fun at times too. The basic premise is alright actually, it's a sort of cross between Alive (1993) with it's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer Bigfoot (another legendary hairy monster) exploitation flick Night of the Demon (1980) which I would defend with my last breath & I have to say it's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as I said it's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written. The character's are mostly annoying American teens, there's the expected arguing, there's the macho hero, the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there's no prizes for originality. There are some plot holes too, if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them? How are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes? Why did the Yeti not kill that bird at the end? It had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her? The 'there are actually two Yeti's running around' twist isn't used to any effect at all either. At least there's a good pace about the film, it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & I never found myself becoming bored with it. There's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not.<br /><br />The one thing you can always say about these Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Features' or 'Beast Feasts' is that the CGI computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again. The plane crash at the start looks awful & the Yeti when it's CGI looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it's on a pogo stick. There one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm, a squashed head, a ripped out heart, some dead bodies, some blood splatter & the best bit when the Yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped-off legs before biting a big chunk out of them. According to the IMDb the actor playing the Yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make-up which seems like a long time since it's actually a pretty tatty looking creation. Apparently the original title was Raksha: Curse of the Snow Demon with Raksha meaning demon in Tibetan Sanskrit, so now you know.<br /><br />This has reasonable production values considering the usual Sci-Fi Channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh, bleak Himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm. The acting isn't that good & I didn't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn't help.<br /><br />Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon is another terrible Sc-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' if I am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it's not very good.\",\n",
              " b'David Milch wrote DEADWOOD like nobody else writes anything: Dictated, open-source and interactive; just-in-time inventory created nearly on-the-spot so actors and crew could barely get it executed. Nearly everyone who can read has been subjected to lessons in civics and history in which glowing images of founding fathers and inspired visionaries brought forth upon this continent a new nation... <br /><br />I think DEADWOOD is an antidote for all manner of propaganda, because it was pointedly intended to illustrate the evolution of orderly society from anarchy. It might have been set 2000 years ago at the conclusion of Republican Rome, but HBO already had something similar scheduled. So Milch turned to a more contemporary point in time in which thousands of imaginations snapped toward The Black Hills, impassioned by an American Dream of personal wealth (The Golden Rule) and beat an amoral path to get (and keep) theirs\\' first, in yet another time of violent transition. Custer died the day the telephone was first publicly demonstrated. Odd. <br /><br />Ironically, the rule of gold and the search for color drew damaged, self-serving anarchists together in a bizarre perversion of selfishness that came to strongly resemble civic pride and benevolent altruism. At least, that\\'s what DEADWOOD presents to me in the form of a truly fascinating entertainment that also unmakes the familiar, laconic Hollywood Western hero, who was the self-censored product of 30s Hollywood moguls\\' anticipatory auto-antisemitism. <br /><br />About a year ago, David Milch presented many of his DEADWOOD intentions to an audience at M.I.T., in the form of a riveting interview. More clearly than in two seasons of DVD commentaries, he justifies his use of profanity in the series, explains his resistance to modern settings, and places the responsibility for understanding the DEADWOOD phenomenon on the audience, because the networks can\\'t be bothered to re-educate anybody. In This class, there will be no yawning. <br /><br />Please check it out. Just drop \"Milch MIT\" into a search engine, and you\\'ll be streaming the 83minute free interview in no time.',\n",
              " b\"Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere is an exploitation thriller which mixes the laid-back hippie attitudes of the 60s with the permissive approach to cinematic sex and violence of the 70s. It comes from Italian director Umberto Lenzi, at the junction where his career was steering away from adventure and thriller movies and sailing into gorier, more controversial waters. Ultimately Lenzi would offend the world with films like Mangiati Vivi! (a.k.a Eaten Alive), and the notoriously sickening Cannibal Ferox. At least Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere isn't particularly offensive or nasty \\xc2\\x96 it's just a routine thriller with a splash of sex and nudity, obvious plot developments, a fashionably downbeat ending, and a toe-tapping soundtrack that is blissfully unrelated to the events on screen!<br /><br />Dick (Ray Lovelock) and Ingrid (Ornella Muti) are a young Scandinavian couple travelling around Europe. They pay their way by selling pornographic photos of themselves. Unfortunately for them, their scheme is uncovered by the somewhat unforgiving Italian police and they are instructed to leave Italy at once. On their way to the border, their car runs out of petrol and they are forced to seek help at a large, secluded villa. Here they meet Barbara Slater (Irene Papas), wife of the NATO colonel who owns the villa. Barbara seems edgy and nervous, especially when she finds them attempting to steal her husband's petrol, but nevertheless invites the couple to stay. It becomes increasingly apparent that Barbara is not to be trusted. Her behaviour seems erratic and at one point she seduces Dick. The young couple slowly come to learn that Barbara has an ulterior motive for having them in her home. Seems she recently murdered her husband and has his body stashed in the trunk of his car\\xc2\\x85. now she plans to frame Dick and Ingrid for her ruthless crime.<br /><br />The film has a few interesting elements and is comparatively subtle by Lenzi's later standards. There is some attempt to set aside time for proper character development, so that the eventual misadventures which befall the protagonists carry a little more weight. The problem is that the characters are rather dull, and the actors aren't really charismatic enough to overcome this. Eugenio Alabiso edits the film quite well, using a variety of flashy techniques to create a sense of atmosphere in several scenes. But again, the central story is too weak and uninvolving \\xc2\\x96 in the end, no amount of flashy editing can overcome the film's pervasive air of dreariness. Once Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere reaches its glumly depressing climax, one realises that very little has really happened. It is a slow-burning film which doesn't build to anything of note. Collectors of these old Italian exploitation-era movies might find something to hold their interest, as will fans of the stars, but for wider audiences there's not a great deal in the film worth getting excited about.\",\n",

He then tries to solve the case all by himself, and the police follow him around.<br /><br />Fun to see Dourif as the main character, and even as a genuine good guy!..

              " b\"Not in sum, but every part seems familiar. It plays like a montage of previous rom coms.<br /><br />There's nothing objectionable about it, but then again there's nothing memorable either. It's blurb, a schedule filler, one in the bank.<br /><br />Pegg and Moran just sleepwalk through the same parts that they always play, not expanding their range on iota. Pegg's cringing everyman is getting quite tired now. Thandie Newton just has to stand in doorways and look pretty. Her character is a prize, not a person. The bit parts are played by the usual assortment of jobbing British actors, also on autopilot. Azaria is the strongest actor, but isn't given much of a part. His character development goes: good, good, good... evil, with no reason given for the sudden transition.<br /><br />Everything about it, Schwimmer's direction included, is just... adequate. There's no snap, no pizazz, and no chemistry between any of the actors, something that becomes painfully obvious when listening to the awkward stilted commentary track. Film making by box ticking. <br /><br />The whole is instantly forgettable, and dreadfully disappointing given the collection of talent working on it.\",\n",
              " b'An idealistic doctor, Paul Henreid, is a counselor or something at a new prison for naughty young girls. No walls, but humane treatment -- that sort of thing. The fly in the ointment is the headmistress or foreman or whatever she is, the top sergeant, who runs the place on a day-to-day basis. And what an old-fashioned meanie she is, groomed like Mrs. Danvers or maybe the wife in \"American Gothic\".<br /><br />This movie was one of a spate that came out in the post-war years dealing with one or another social problem, often, as here, penology. Among the others were \"The Snake Pit,\" \"Sniper,\" \"Gentleman\\'s Agreement,\" \"Crossfire,\" others whose titles don\\'t come to mind at the moment. This is a lesser example of the genre, but not entirely without interest.<br /><br />What makes it interesting is that, though Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman\\'s husband in \"Casablanca\" seven years earlier, was by now over the hill and reduced to B pictures, the movie is full of those naughty young girls, including the 18-year-old Rita Moreno and the 19-year-old Ann Francis. They run around in their skivvies, get into fights, talk nasty, are cynical about everything, trying to run away -- in other words, these luscious young beauties are just begging to be spanked. That\\'s all they really need. They don\\'t need an understanding headmaster, just a couple of whacks. Oh, not savage whacks. Not at all. Rather, deeply caring whacks, whacks of love, so to speak, not enough to hurt but just enough to warm. Why didn\\'t Paul Henreid try that instead of this antiquated humanism? Huh? I\\'ll bet he WANTED to turn Ann Francis over his knee, that lanky and insinuating blond vixen, and teach her a lesson. You can see it in his face. The gentle smile can\\'t mask the lascivious grin of the maniac underneath. Come to think of it, if that didn\\'t work, why he could just have THEM spank HIM. They\\'d be learning a trade too -- professional dominatrix. <br /><br />Anyway, if he didn\\'t, he must be as crazy as the rest of this unimaginative movie. Some of the shots are striking; in others the lighting alone could have been handled by an alert ten-year-old kid. But why go on?<br /><br />This movie is \"reformist\" in the same way that Cecil B. DeMille\\'s early movies showed a lot of nudity, just to make sure we knew how sinful nudity was; or in the same way as one of those anti-war pictures that show us the brutality of combat before we inevitably win the battle. What hypocrisy.',\n",
              " b\"Ninja The Protector is a watchable ninja flick. However, The Ninja Protector isn't a great ninja flick, its plot is just crappy. Let's begin with the fact that most of its ninjas are white, even though that some are Chinese. Its plot was a combination of exploitation, ninja action and a crappy drama, I know that it sounds cheesy and fun, but it's not that great. Actually, The Ninja Protector has boring scenes whereas the some of its fights save it. The ninjas are mostly white as I said above, but they have some interesting swords and daggers. Its plot is so awful that I won't even write about it, However, its soundtrack is actually cheesy and fun. Morever, its soundtrack is maybe the best part in this silly film, it is heard after and during the cheesy fights. In a nutshell, The Ninja Protector isn't very recommended, unless you really like ninja movies. 4/10\",\n",
              " b\"Great directing, editing, photography and acting! It's difficult to make a movie about someone as well known as John Lennon and tell us something new, but the writer and his collaborators do just that. Phillip McQuillan is really exceptional, capturing the heady mix of hurt, anger and brilliance that John Lennon possessed. He has moments that are so right they're eerie. Christine Kavanagh, Blair Brown and Jamie Glover also shine. The mood of the early Beatles performances are captured perfectly by the hand-held camerawork and stylish, edgy cutting.\",\n",
              " b'Given how corny these movies are, you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them. The movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there. The inhabitants were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), who gets haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter\\'s cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much into character.<br /><br />\"The House That Dripped Blood\" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from just being neat, there might be some undertones: it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs. assumed horror. Like in \"The Shining\", we might ask whether the house/hotel itself holds some memory of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul\\'s co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! Around the time that this came out, she also starred in \"Countess Dracula\" and \"The Vampire Lovers\" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will remain known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT SCREAM QUEEN! I\\'d like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-star in something.<br /><br />I guess that the only weird scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read that right. What kind of a name is \"Denholm\" anyway? Oh well. A very cool movie.',\n",
              " b\"Long Time Dead opens to a caption that informs us that we're in 'Morocco 1979' where a group of people are holding a s\\xc3\\xa9ance which gets out of hand when a fire demon called a Djinn appears & supposedly kills everyone... Long Time Dead then cuts to present day London where four house-mates, Rob (Joe Absolom), Liam (Alex Newman), Webster (Lukas Haas) & Stella (Lara Belmont) are planning to go out for the night. They hook up with their soon to be new house-mate the drug dealing Joe (Mel Raido) & three friends, Lucy (Marsha Thomason), Spencer (James Hillier) & Liam's girlfriend Annie (Melanie Gutteridge). While sitting around at a club they begin to have a discussion on what the biggest buzz in life is, from this rather innocent sounding topic the subject of s\\xc3\\xa9ance's is brought up & for some reason they all decide to hold one. They find a suitable venue which appears to be in attic space above the club & begin, unfortunately they release the fire demon Djinn which spells the words 'ALL DIE' out on the Ouija board which freaks them all out, as it would I suppose. Shortly after Annie dies in an accident & her body has burns on it, the remaining member's of the group feel something is wrong & do some research which leads to some unexpected answers & the discovery that maybe not everyone is as they appear or who they claim. As more of the friends continue to die in accidents a way must be found to send the evil Djinn back before it completes it's mission to kill all those who summoned it...<br /><br />Directed Adam Marcus I thought that this English & French co-production was a somewhat modest & undemanding way to pass 90 odd minutes. The script by Eitan Arrusi, Chris Baker, Daniel Bronzite & Andy Day really isn't anything special & I can't quite believe it took four writers to come up with this. Generally speaking Long Time Dead is rather slow & uneventful & the characters are so bland & similar with most of them looking & sounding exactly the same & the only one's I could really distinguish between are Lucy because she's black & Joe because of his hair! Everyone else barely registered with me & that made it very hard to care about anyone or anything, oh & they're an unlikeable bunch of teenage stereotypes as well which didn't help the film. The script also features various lapses of logic, at the end I just couldn't stop thinking that it was a bit of a coincidence that a bunch of kids would just happen to hold a s\\xc3\\xa9ance & summon the exact same demon that their landlord & one of their Father's did years earlier, a fact which they only discover later on in the film. There is another scene in particular I keep thinking about that sums Long Time Dead & it's silly script up, when two people break into a police guarded house & turn the lights on only for the police officer on guard to be conveniently looking in the opposite direction & only looking back at the house literally seconds after the lights have been turned off. I also hated the scare tactic's that director Marcus employed, I mean people hearing noises only to have one of their 'friends' grab their shoulder & apologise for scaring them. What do these people think will happen exactly? Can't they just call out & say who it is that's creeping around in the shadows? Long Time Dead uses this clich\\xc3\\xa9d & lazy technique on a number of increasingly annoying occasions. There are also plenty of cheap demon point-of-view shots which presumably help save money by not having to show the demon itself. On the positive side it tells it's story well enough I suppose & while it's not exceptional Long Time Dead is a well made film generally speaking. I also liked the ending where the Djinn appears to win, it's nice not to have a happy sugar coated ending for a change. Long Time Dead is one of those horror films that has nothing really wrong with it & entertains to a certain extent but suffers by being just so average a few script problems that should have been ironed out especially since four people worked on the thing. The gore quotient is sadly lacking with nothing more graphic than a few splashes of blood & someone being burnt. As for the Djinn itself the best the filmmakers could come up with are some CGI demon eyes on an ordinary actor. There's no sex or nudity either but there is some swearing & drug usage which the film treats lightly & doesn't say is right but neither does it say it is wrong just that it's a normal teenage thing to do. Overall I thought Long Time Dead was a slightly below average horror that didn't do much for me but at the same time I have seen much worse & at least it kept me watching until the end. Don't spend any sort of money on it but if you can catch it on TV for free & there's nothing else on then it's probably just about worth an hour & a half of your time, but only just.\",\n",

              " b'The greatest shortcoming of this series is perhaps the lack of an in-depth story and associated cinematics that were in the past, part and parcel of all Command and Conquer games. The interface is also annoying and very slow. The load times are pathetic even on faster computers. But the game itself is excellent and includes not two, but 3 sides. The levels are however, a tad repetitive and not very creative. There are plenty of units and associated gib effects to make up for that though. The America and China campaigns are too easy on normal skill and only during multiplayer is there a real challenge that will force you to think more strategically. I think this game could have been much better if Westwood had more time on their hands.',\n",

              " b\"a horror film hasn't given me chills in a while. this film made me feel as isolated and terrified as the characters in the movie. I had seen the American re-make before this film, and i'm kind of glad I did, because I got to save the best for last. If you were disappointed by the American Pulse, this predecessor will certainly make up for that sorry excuse for a horror.<br /><br />I can say without a doubt this is one of my top films to watch alone in a dark room if I wanted to scare the hell out of myself. And that just puts a big grin on my face. Not to mention, the lighting and cinematography in this film is also really well done, and adds a lot to the completely creepy mood throughout. While the story may be hard to follow if you don't know the history behind the film beforehand, it's scary either way. I've watched it twice now, and it's just as good the second time around. Even though this film is considered an older J-horror film, it's still fresh in my book.<br /><br />I think horror film makers that rely on cheap thrills and gore should take Kairo for a spin, they'd learn a lot from it. Kairo is a truly haunting, scary film that will leave your eyes wide open in terror. 10/10\",\n",

The cast is pretty good: Douglas as the weary executive, Kerr as his understanding wife, and especially Dunaway as his mistress. Kerr boldly bares more than her soul. Also on hand are Boone and Cronyn, but the entire cast is wasted in this nonsensical drama. Kazan tries to liven things up with slick, annoyingly amateurish camera work but fails miserably, not helped by the lackluster source material, the director's own trashy, best-selling novel. The plot is rambling and uninteresting and the film drags on much too long.\",\n",

The entire child abuse part is really well detailed as well as the psychological trauma, but that's about it.\",\n",

When the series was canceled, I felt there was something amiss and I wanted the network to bring Punky Brewster back... they never did. Now I cannot find reruns anywhere, did everyone forget how special and beautiful this little show was? It was one of those hidden gems, a show that brought the whole family together.<br /><br />When I came home from school in the afternoon, there were two shows: Small Wonder and Punky Brewster. When they came on, I would stop whatever I was doing, glue myself to the television, slip on my different-colored sneakers and instantly I'd have Punky Power! I remember how Soliel Moon Frye lit up the room every time she smiled, it was like you knew everything was going to be alright. I loved how the show was always fresh and innocent, much better than the violence-induced cop shows and legal dramas of today's audience.\",\n",
              " b\"It is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations. Yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character, that it is, in my humble opinion, one of the very greatest films of all time.<br /><br />The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see Jacques Rivette's fantastic C\\xc3\\xa9line and Julie Go Boating, which was made around the same time). It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change.<br /><br />It involves a supposedly liberated m\\xc3\\xa9nage-\\xc3\\xa0-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). Yet Alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. The women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze.<br /><br />The film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the New Wave, having starred (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave, but he should be.<br /><br />There is no improvisation (unlike in John Cassavetes's similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film is resonant with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character Marie was based on, did too. The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by Veronika delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. This mesmerising, personal, and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around.\",\n",
              " b'Since you can ask your friends\\' opinions and read reviews about mainstream films most anywhere, I try comment on the smaller, harder to find films which have little written about them (and the few comments you will find are usually cast and crew plugging the film). Hopefully I\\'ll help someone who is debating on whether the effort they might put into finding and seeing a smaller, hard to find film is really worth it.<br /><br />That said, \"Cyxork 7\" - a very high concept comedy - fails on every single level. I did not laugh once during the entire film, which is surprising especially since Greg Proops is involved. Dropping the f bomb for emphasis is not funny. Having running commentary in numerous points is not funny. Kicking someone in the balls is not funny unless the setup and payoff is good. For the entire film, the jokes have no setup and what\\'s more, the characters are not only flat and uninteresting, their motivations hardly make any sense.<br /><br />Like I said, the premise of the film had me interested, which is why I saw it at the Fine Arts Theater in Los Angeles. But the film seems to have an identity crisis of whether it wants to be drama or comedy.<br /><br />The editing was awful. The scenes drag far, far too long and instead of cutting on a joke or trimming needless scenes (maybe because there are a lot that don\\'t go anywhere), they linger. In particular I think of the scene between the 2 actors who have an affair on the side and the camera pans out for a few seconds then we cut. The actors all seemed uncomfortable with their lines.<br /><br />Ray Wise does a decent job and plays it straight, but the only problem is so does everyone else. This is a comedy, where things need to be over the top to emphasize the ridiculousness of the concept. Perhaps the best scene is that of the producer, which at least was colorful and he seemed like someone you could hate.<br /><br />That brings me to another point, there\\'s no sense of tone. The GNN news thing - is it supposed to be serious? Because the 2 anchors swear like sailors as though this were funny, and are very self aware of how cute they are being, which sucks you right out of the humor. (Now it would be much funnier if they played it straight but said absurd things). I mean, you have to ground this in some level of reality. Also, the text full of swears and innuendo was not funny but annoying, and simply repeating what the anchors already had said. Now if they had been established as an alternate news channel MAYBE I could buy it, but even so, it\\'s not so much the credibility as the fact the actors seem to giggle as though they think everything they say is hilarious.<br /><br />As for the plot, so many loose threads never come to fruition: the lesbian story between the news correspondent (why is she there again?) and the cam operator - I guess it\\'s funny because they\\'re lesbians? The nerd who is taping the behind the scenes footage and trying to direct his girlfriend act never makes sense - I thought maybe he would use the footage as blackmail, or to show he\\'s a better director, or perhaps he & everyone else who wants to direct would create a bunch of competing directors, but nope I was wrong, this goes nowhere and just seems like a lazy cutaway to bad quality video. The pregnant actor\\'s wife who held everyone hostage and then everything\\'s hunky dory? <br /><br />I understand this was low budget which is fine but it\\'s not funny. I actually would have been happier to see more physical comedy which would have lightened the tone instead of everyone being so serious. Oh yes, why would nobody on the crew leave instead of risk their lives? Do they want to break in that bad? (Again, lack of motivation here). <br /><br />The one saving grace was the idea of actors killing themselves to boost their careers. Could have been funny but then it becomes very dark and again the tone is awkward. Not to mention the final \"And she died by a cart\" post script at the end was out of place. <br /><br />Pretty much I was left scratching my head. So did they complete the movie or just the shot? What happens to the franchise? To the wife? To everyone else\\'s careers? But by that time, you\\'ll be walking out of the theater or turning off the film because the movie doesn\\'t seem to care and neither should you about seeing this film.<br /><br />VERDICT: STAY AWAY 2 out of 10 stars',\n",

Baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw. The format is similar to the previous show, after all now they had found the winning formula why change things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick an M.P.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically, the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a stellar cast',\n",

Then in 1960 this doubled to 3 billion and then it accelerated to 4 billion in 1976. Right now we are heading towards 7 billion people and they all have to be fed, need schooling, want things we all want. I do like warning documentaries but they should tell the real problem and that is overpopulation. Of course politics won't burn their hands on this problem because of the powers of religions but the real problem are Too Many People, that is why the wild animals are leaving, dying out, there is not enough space. <br /><br />In this documentary, the same as Al Gore's, has many faults as global warming has nothing to do with mankind. Throughout the 4.5 billion years of history of the earth, climate has changed all the time. Greenland used to be green, pools have changed and Ice-times followed by warming up is part of the earth history. And we cannot stop this, we are living on a very violent planet, nothing is stable, earth quakes, volcanic eruptions, changing of magnetic fields, drifting of continental shells. Pollution is something we can stop, overpopulation we can stop. Climate change not. Of course with Global Warming scam, taxes can be raised without protest, trying to stop population grows is dangerous for politicians.\",\n",
              " b\"Apparently this movie set out to make its viewers feel bad, and it certainly worked for me. This is one of the dullest scripts I have seen turned into movie lately. Having read sk4ek's comment on this, maybe it would be fair to add that it was made from a novel, and I watched the subtitled version (and I don't understand Japanese), so it seems I probably didn't get a lot of what made the novel good. Anyway, the script is all about what a gargantuan a**hole Kitano's character is, but whatever else happens just doesn't add much to the story. Just imagine the worst things a father could possibly do to his family, sequence them on a timeline, and you have the plot of this movie. But there simply is no character evolvement, no turning point, nothing that gives an interesting twist to things, they only keep getting worse.<br /><br />***mild spoiler below***<br /><br />Once I thought the story was going to take off, when another illegitimate son of A**hole Father moved in with the family, finally someone who had the potential to give a swerve to the plot line. After being defeated in a fistfight, he tells the boy who narrates the whole story to study hard, walks away and gets shot ten days later off screen. Segue boring story continued. The cinematography is alright, but not outstanding, and not enough to save this movie.\",\n",

They\\'re disgruntled Vietnam veterans and she\\'s looking to beef up the military and, they\\'re guessing, go to war again. She\\'s utterly without charisma, couldn\\'t deliver a rousing speech if her life depended on it, doesn\\'t come off as intelligent, and looks kind of like someone\\'s homely grandma. Clearly, she must be stopped at any cost. Furthermore, she\\'s labeled at one point as \"mysterious,\" and the only way the character makes even a little sense is if she basically popped up out of nowhere recently--had no past *at all*--and somehow quickly became some party\\'s primary candidate. I\\'ll refrain from giving away what even the back of the VHS box can\\'t help but give away, but Westinghouse\\'s big secret is just another fragrant turd of stupid the movie lays down. It\\'ll be obvious from the word go anyway.<br /><br />Whenever I thought I could give up for a bit and mentally move past one lump of potent idiocy like a speed bump just so I could follow the movie, along came two more. At one point I literally sat staring slack-jawed at the screen for probably ten minutes because I just couldn\\'t deal with it. The movie tries to take swipes at religion, politics, country music, the military, aerobics workout videos, etc., etc., but it\\'s all so amateurish and painfully unfunny that it seems about on the level of a really bad public access show with a mysteriously large budget. It plays about like an eleven year old wrote a script and, through a series of farcical errors, it got produced and turned into a real movie with real money behind it.<br /><br />It\\'s got plenty of garish 80s style behind it--the fact that the director worked on music videos came as no surprise, nor did the fact that this was his first movie--but its substance is practically nil. The movie has no idea that\\'s the case, however. It seems at times to believe that it\\'s a satire, but it\\'s way too dim to be capable of meeting any satirical ambitions. On a second viewing it might be laughable, but there\\'s so much to deal with that the first time around was just a painful exercise in masochism. I\\'m not sure I\\'d even recommend it as an entertainingly bad movie. Useful as a trial of sorts, a challenge for you and your friends to get through, perhaps.',\n",

The first film, 1995\\'s \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie\", brought the six butt-kicking teens from the Fox Kids series to the big screen for the first time. That movie was not all that bad. It had some decent special effects, a somewhat interesting bad guy (Ivan Ooze), and the six young actors who play the Power Rangers were fun to watch. Plus, that film had a bigger budget. But they went back to the cheapness of the TV show with \"Turbo\". The special effects, production design, and costumes are so cheap and cheesy that you wonder why 20th Century Fox gave the go-ahead to let these filmmakers (who are close to the TV show) make this film. Also, the script is much worse than it was in the first movie. Bulk and Skull have more screen time here. It has one of the least interesting villains of all time (actually, a villainess). It\\'s very, very, very, very, very, juvenile. And the Power Ranger actors look as if they want to escape this atrosity. So I have one question. Why did they release this movie to theaters? This should have been released straight to video. Or better yet, release it as a TV movie, were this series started in the first place. This movie was totally inappropriate for the big screen. <br /><br />* (out of four)',\n",

Oh, and one of them wears glasses.<br /><br />All these people do is stand around in their depressing adobe hut and drink and drink and drink and drink. Eventually they weld some barrels together to make a goofy-looking tank to evade The Killer Dogs With Bathmats On Them. It\\'s a trip of only a few yards, yet they have to stop to rest frequently.

              " b'\"The Evening Star\" is one of those movies that you can watch many times. It contains more laughs then \"Terms of Endearment\" and also less depth. But if you watch this movie in the observation that it is solely entertainment, and not to be taken seriously, it\\'s a lot of fun.<br /><br />Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine- reprising her Oscar winning role) is now dealing with her three grown Grandchildren. One is a saint, Teddy, who is already married with child. Tommy, the \"problem child\" of the original film, is in prison. And Melanie (Juliette Lewis), the youngest, is struggling through college because she\\'s going through a rebellious phase and likes hanging out with her sleazy boyfriend, or mooching off Patsie (Miranda Richardson), the now very rich divorc\\xc3\\xa9e. There\\'s also the loyal housekeeper Rosie (Marion Ross), who despite always being on her duties and quick to have a sarcastic comeback, is falling in love with the next door neighbor Arthur (Ben Johnson- in his last screen performance).<br /><br />All of this is a little hokey, but the performances more then make up for it. When Aurora starts seeing a therapist (Bill Paxton) and then sleeping with him, people start whispering about her reputation. And when Melanie keeps going back and forth between her relationship, she finally finds peace with Aurora, who she at first despised.<br /><br />\"The Evening Star\" is by no means superior to \"Terms of Endearment\". That movie is a landmark in it\\'s own right. But it is more fun- in my opinion. MacLaine, in a funny performance, seems more lively and witty here then her original time around. And the most fun of all is to watch her and Miranda Richardson go at it - almost like \"Grumpy Old Men\"- but FUNNIER. A scene in an airplane perfectly displays their hatred for one another- but in a way, they are best friends- since they\\'re always around each other, competing, gossiping or nagging.<br /><br />To wrap it up, it\\'s a long movie with a lot of unnecessary subplots (the death toll was ridiculous), but keep in mind this is also based on the book, so do we blame the filmmakers or the author? \"The Evening Star\" is a movie that should be watched for a good laugh. You don\\'t have to have seen the first one to understand it. True, Debra Winger is missing (but if you saw the first film you\\'d know why), but I am rating this solely on how well it entertained me.',\n",
              " b\"So yes this is a nice harem Anime, oh wait, this is supposed to be a horror? You sure could have fooled me. In terms of horror and suspense Higurashi is a complete and utter failure. Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on 100% excess and shock-factoring.<br /><br />Higurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In 1983 a young male transfer student comes to a small town. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something.<br /><br />As wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a filler arc when something finally happens after 6 episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next, until something may just happen only for it to be a classic and clich\\xc3\\xa9d horror blunder trick. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it. So yes this series seriously lack suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller.<br /><br />Until some annoying detective constantly shows up to go over the SAME mystery we heard 5 episodes ago! The series can work up it's suspense and chill level, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not? Sure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again. But there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it.<br /><br />I can't express how dull of a horror this really was. Die hard horror lovers may want to stick to Elfen Lied, as for general suspense lovers (Like me) you may want to avoid this one. Apparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.\",\n",

The film explores the conflicts between his day-to-day job, his problems with his randy father who eventually gets himself in too deep with the much bigger and more brutal gangsters, his business partners, and the young Chinese woman he eventually finds to teach him to play the piano on a level that can get him an audition for his dead mother\\'s former manager.<br /><br />It\\'s based on James\\' Toback\\'s 27-year-old American film \"Fingers\" which starred Harvey Keitel and which is much admired; I haven\\'t seen the original but its hard to believe that Keitel was any better in the central role than Romain Duris (a look-alike for a young Daniel Day-Lewis for all you Brit-fanciers out there), who offers brutality, insensitivity and arrogance in most of his daily life, but with an undercurrent of melancholy and self-doubt that makes him one of the most real characters I\\'ve seen on screen in a while. I loved the look of the film; it\\'s shot in Paris but you\\'d never know, it\\'s all close-ups, cramped apartment spaces and dirty night-time streets, no scenery but the emotions on the expressive face of Duris and a few of the other characters.<br /><br />The film doesn\\'t talk down to the audience, something I find very refreshing after a summer of blockbusters...the first few minutes are a bit chaotic and confusing and they mirror the troubled protagonist. I love that, though he seems at times to be making progress out of his unpleasant and violent existence, you\\'re never quite sure...until the spectacular ending, where everything wraps up beautifully...or does it?

On behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film, I extend them an apology. Obviously, some criticisms posted here are harsh in light of their credit being accidentally. Our production values were negligible and our \"special effects\" were quite special indeed, but the plot is very strong and the cinematography by John McLeod is superb.

Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself . These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause \\xc2\\x96 to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Excellent script.<br /><br />Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is superb and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.\",\n",

Don\\'t get me wrong; I love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy. But please, will the collective Braintrust that greenlights this stuff please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty \"Woooooosaaaaaah\", then rewind twentyfive years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time? Then actually MAKE some movies like that again? <br /><br />I have nothing against poker, but the entire pop-culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother thinks their Maverick now (not that half of them even will get that reference). Some executive said, \"Hey, what demographic do you want to leach $9.50 out of?\" \"I know, sir.

A film that I\\'ve seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and more often than not, starring Dolph Lundgren. <br /><br />Now don\\'t misunderstand me;I am not a film snob. Over-the-top artsy flicks like The English Patient don\\'t float my boat, but generic films that should not have even been made straight to DVD bother the hell out of me too.

When I finally saw this movie I was this disappointed for many reasons. <br /><br />001. It offers very little background on Leatherface and The Beginning shows him to be a ruthless killer. Yet in TCM (remake) he has feelings. This movie made him be a monster like Freddy and Jason.<br /><br />002. Who in the hell cast Jordana Brewster? This woman does nothing in this film except run and whine. I\\'m glad she was killed off. Sorry, Jordana but TCM just wasn\\'t for you.<br /><br />003. Why does Hollywood always want to kill everybody? Sure it was great for the first few remakes but in every movie you lead the audience to believe someone will actually survive and you kill them off like 10 seconds before the credits? Get some new material!<br /><br />004. One good thing about the movie is how the Sheriff came to be. He kills a cop then passes off a masquerade of being one. He\\'s even more evil and bigamist than the first. The whole soldier/marine torture was just brilliant and the bubble wrap almost death was alright. It had me going!<br /><br />Things that made no sense:<br /><br />001. The biker chick. What a waste! She makes the survivors crash into a cow on the road; planning to rob them and the damn woman gets shot by the Sheriff. Dumb! Thanks Sheriff! <br /><br />002. The hook impaled in the woman was too gory. Why? <br /><br />003. The fat lady that says \"Oh my, my, my\". It was hilarious when they shoved her against the door. She must weigh 500+ pounds. <br /><br />004. The birth scene should have had more details and more background on Leatherface. <br /><br />005. Leatherface\\'s personality in this film. No more sensitivity. Just steel heart!<br /><br />Throughout, the movie provided a few good scares. Too much hyped scenes and the ending was just dumb. Why make a movie if you plan to kill everybody? You could\\'ve let Jordana survive like Jessica Biel in TCM and Burns in TCM The Original. Hollywood needs to reconsider what they plan to produce and remake.

Now I realize, none of us is getting younger, but what\\'s the thing with Kristofferson\\'s eyebrows? His acting is particularly wooden in this role, but Cheryl Ladd - good god, her performance (a la Pussy Galore in the film Goldfinger) would have stopped any other career cold. Strangely, the sets held up fairly well; the steaming turbines; the weirdly flat body bags, and so forth. But the cheap looking device that Cheryl and her tough pals are looking for - a device that supposed to turn this \"time travel\" joke of a story around - looks like a reject from a grade Z movie.<br /><br />It\\'s really like two movies in one, or one inside the other.

Between Luke and Kam the attempt to convince us they were the Edward and Paige from before felt so forced that I just kept asking myself all through the movie why did they change Julia Stilles, who had done such a great job. The producers obviously made more money than they thought with the first movie, and decided to make a second but came out with such a lousy result, that I think its a pity now that my image of the first movie is seconded with this sequel one!

This is the tale of Daniel, a killer-for-profit(be it assassinations or murder and the subsequent sale of cadavers). Between bouts of drugs, partner-swapping, S&M and crime, Daniel ruminates on the nature of fascism. I don\\'t want to give away too much, but suffice to say that this movie doesn\\'t take the tried and true(not to mention clich\\xc3\\xa9) Hollywood approach of force feeding its audience an affable, cuddly lead character. Daniel\\'s opinions may shock and offend you. The movie\\'s morality is ambiguous and its philosophy unique. If you need a likable, handsome Tom Cruise type \"Hit Man\" in order to digest a movie, don\\'t watch this. If you are not afraid to have your own notions of film and character challenged, this movie should be an unexpected treat. The film\\'s budget and non-professional cast are evident.

I felt Saskia's fright when she thought she lost Rex initially, and her description of her dream made me feel chills. When she disappeared, Rex's combination of rage, frustration, anxiety, and grief was torture to watch. A particularly powerful moment was when he slammed the car door shut so hard the window crumbled into pieces.<br /><br />Watching Rex become consumed in every way by his quest to find Saskia was also extremely difficult to watch, although it was certainly inevitable. I found the professor's description of his actions appalling in many cases, the most notable one being when he fixates on Saskia and we see his POV. Seeing Saskia warmly respond to him was devastating, knowing what would happen. Throughout the film there was an overwhelming sense of doom and isolation, like this was a cruel world where even in the most idyllic settings evil lurked everywhere and attempting to fight it was futile. Rex undergoes one of the most harrowing emotional ordeals of any movie character ever, and when he is at the end of his rope his crucial decision would seem so insane out of context but viewers understand that it really is his only choice. The shock ending, especially the way it was done, almost made me scream, and I will never forget the final shot. The Vanishing could be shown in any film class on direction, as an example of perfection. Material that could have been turned into just a mediocre thriller with would have seemed like a lame twist was turned by George Sluizer into an utterly harrowing filmgoing experience. And that is the right word, because a movie like The Vanishing is not just watched-it is experienced.<br /><br />I estimate I have seen around 700 movies in my life, and horror is my favorite genre.

              " b\"I once showed Chuck Jones's 'Cheese Chasers' to my best friend Amy, who remarked that it was the strangest cartoon she'd ever seen! Part of the masterful but lesser known Hubie and Bertie series, which more often than not tackled darker subjects than most cartoons, 'Cheese Chasers' takes suicide and mental illness as its subject and runs with its unique premise to create an exceptional and exceptionally black film. Having eaten more cheese than they can stand in the space of one night, the mice Hubie and Bertie decide there is nothing left to live for and therefore they should commit suicide. This one little event throws off the natural order in the animal kingdom to the extent that a cat and a dog also long for death by the cartoons end. Subverting the usual chase formula so that each character runs away from the character they would usually be trying to catch, 'Cheese Chasers' is a unique and absolutely wonderful cartoon. Just witnessing how disturbed each animal is by the twisted turn of events is enough to equally disturb the viewer while also provoking plenty of laughter. 'Cheese Chasers' is a highlight in the too often overlooked Hubie and Bertie series, perhaps only topped by the even blacker 'The Hypo-chondri-cat'.\",\n",
              " b'Walt Disney\\'s \"The Rookie\" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35.<br /><br />The film opens with a brief synopsis of Morris\\' childhood, which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man. And even when his family settled for good in football crazed Texas, Morris\\' passion for baseball remained strong.<br /><br />The childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn\\'t work out.<br /><br />Morris\\'s team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams. They turn the table on him, telling him that he should try out for a Major League team. At several times when he pitches to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws. Morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district, he will try out for a Major League team.<br /><br />Big Lake does win district and, adhering to his end of the deal, Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays try out. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another try out with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays.<br /><br />This leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his Major League dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home. And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children.<br /><br />Morris signs with the Devil Rays, begins at the AA level and moves up quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season winds down, the chances of him getting \"called up\" grow increasingly slim.<br /><br />For the most part, I love this movie. There are lots of great performances and likable characters and it\\'s easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris. Also, the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels. And most of all, it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Still, the movie has some flaws. While generally accurate, it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores Morris\\' Christian faith. But considering Disney\\'s left wing zeal, that\\'s not surprising.<br /><br />Presumably, a lot of the exaggerations/fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic. Yet the 20 minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie.<br /><br />For example, from birth until his family settled in Texas for good when he was 12, Morris re-located 14 times. And his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left (pitching) shoulder, thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable.<br /><br />To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it\\'s good to not only watch \"The Rookie\" but to watch the DVD\\'s documentary, check out the aforementioned link to the movie\\'s inaccuracies and probably also to read Morris\\' biography, also titled \"The Rookie.\" I haven\\'t read the book but I hope to one of these days.<br /><br />But overall, \"The Rookie\" is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10',\n",

Film makers have made other attempts like this and they always seem to go wrong. \"Fritz the Cat\", \"Heavy Metal\" ... they just don\\'t seem to work. But this is hardly even an honest attempt.

              " b'There was some decent photography and camera work. Robert Ryan should have played Custer, at least he didn\\'t have an Irish accent. However the plot, directing and waste of Cinerama film was almost as bad as the History. Why doesn\\'t someone make an accurate movie about Custer? He really is a fascinating study. He really was a \"boy \"General\" in the Civil War and even though most West Point Grads who were like Custer, in the right place at the right time for promotions; his rise in rank was phenomenal.<br /><br />Custer was an American hero of the time who went bust, but only a few people realize it at this late date. I live near the graves of several Confederate Soldiers who surrendered and should have been treated as POW\\'s. Custer had them hung. Lucky for him that he was on the winning side, and he didn\\'t have reporters running around with cameras.<br /><br />All this may not have much to do with the movie, but since the producers didn\\'t have the guts to put a disclaimer on their film that any any resemblance to real characters is strictly accidental, I will continue to describe some of the errors of the film itself.<br /><br />The Civil War battle scenes were obviously not filmed in locations close to resembling Northern Virgina. I believe General Phil Sheridan had one arm, and he was a real General who saved the Union from disaster in the Shenadoah Valley. His character as played in the movie is not accurate. Custer, like most officers who remained in the service after the Civil War, was reduced in rank. He was a Lt. Colonel when he died, although I looked hard to see his rank, and couldn\\'t see it. I was in the military and in combat, and rank is nearly always prominently displayed. I also know that enlisted men never eat steak for breakfast, as portrayed in the film. They were lucky if they got more than biscuits and coffee.<br /><br />Custer was the head of a regiment of cavalry. I have seen some pictures of cannons being hauled around in the west, but generally, the cavalry means mounted men on horses, not infantry or artillery.<br /><br />While in duty in the West, Custer was convicted of 7 offenses in a military court and his fine was loss of a year\\'s pay. Sheridan did get him off the hook. The film attempts to portray Washington as the primary villain, but in reality, it was finding gold in the Black Hills that lead to the end of the Indians rights to the Black Hills. Whether Custer, or others looked the other way defending the Native American\\'s rights was moot. A nation that had just fought a major conflict and still had weapons and trained soldiers was simply a fact of life. What was really tragic about Custer and the real inaccuracy of the film, is that Custer\\'s political ambitions are not shown. That is the theory of most historians as to why he lead his troops into such a disastrous military situation. He knew that the total might of western troops could easily defeat the hostiles, but if he won a major victory with a small army, he would achieve immense fame. The one tell tale sign that the writers of this film were on to the real Custer is when he said that Juan Pizzaro conquered the Inca Civilization with less than 200 men. Custer was responsible for the safety of his men. He sacrificed them to gain that same immortality. Wouldn\\'t this story be better than wasting Robert Shaw\\'s talents?',\n",

Not to mention, HUGE plot twists are treated in a mundane way and many events are altered, discarded, or invented. Also, the character development in the movie lacks what the novel can provide. In a word, it SUCKS! While I realize that this is a movie website, if you are going to make a movie based on a mystery novel, you should probably at least attempt to maintain the integrity of the original work. Otherwise, just rob the general theme, give the people new names, and pass it off as your own.

Also the movie has a good southern Gothic feel to it. The movie though was mediocre but watchable. Glynnis O'Connor and Robby Benson (excellent chemistry in this and Jeremy(a better movie) make this a worthwhile effort. I have something to say about the comments of the boy being raped in the movie. It was rape. Even if it was consensual (which the boy thought it was) the boy was under 18. That is statutory rape. Even if he had tendencies or was gay or bi, that older man was taking advantage of him, a minor.\",\n",

Game Of Death is Bruce Lee\\'s worst movie. This is an obvious truth. In terms of quality Game Of Death is sometimes even lower than Bruce Le or Bruce Li\\'s movies. The sequence where Bruce Lee\\'s face is pasted over the mirror (As others have mentioned) is truly as shoddy as it gets and overall the movie has a few alright action sequences in the beginning but it\\'s all very sub-par stuff. That is until Bruce Lee takes on Danny Inasanto and Kareem Abdoul Jabbar and of course which boosts its rating into low mediocrity. Also of notice (Though it\\'s all blatantly obvious even to those who have never seen a Bruce Lee movie) is the use of a stand in, in which the stand in wears sunglasses, bandage over his face, an old man\\'s costume and of course a hilariously bad fake beard. All of this is laced with Bruce Lee footage from his earlier movies. Usually to a closeup of Lee stock footage then followed by the stunt double\\'s back. In other words this is a very badly made movie but what makes it worth watching at least on a genre level is the climax which is awesome in its crispness and pace. In fact the only thing that leaves an impression on one after watching this, is how much better Lee\\'s original version would\\'ve easily been had he lived to complete it because as we know Robert Clouse added 90% new footage and made it into what we got here. Still worth a look for die hard fans (Like me) who will watch anything with Bruce Lee. Because of the awesome climax Game Of Death earns mediocrity the same way an A+ on a test would bring a grade of a D+ up to a C-.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)',\n",

              " b\"At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. It's also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.\",\n",

There's even alien drug use(a cocaine type drug called Nyborg, we actually witness the hallucinations the aliens have while driving their ship to a space station)! Perfect entertainment for the Midnite Movie crowd, but could be offensive to women and of a moral authority. Quite lurid and grotesque at times..this is not for all tastes.<br /><br />Tales include a New York City cabbie of the future, with a disintegrating beam loaded in his car for anyone who tries an attempt to harm or rob him, who gets mixed up with a mysterious dame holding the orb and gangsters desiring to possess it, a young boy transformed into a muscular warrior who must defend a blond dame against a seemingly unkillable king and evil witch both vying for the orb, a navy crew being turned into creepy skeleton monsters by the orb during WWII while the fighter captain must abort for a spot on Earth where other ships have wrecked not knowing what lies in wait for him, a crew of aliens responsible for human mutations thanks to the orb in their possession with a robotic captain who kidnaps a Jewish hottie hoping to marry her, and a battle between orb infected human monsters and a female warrior from an ancient race.<br /><br />Some really great animation, especially in the final tale.\",\n",

Granted not all marriages are carbon copies of the ones on the show, but at least it hits on ones that are familiar. I found that the awkward moments with Mickey (Mike Binder) and his wife (Sonya Walger) looked like bad acting seemed to emphasize that awkward feelings they were having. Little nuances like this made it a little better for me. And the support characters are real to me. Especially since I have been on both sides (being the single guy and the married guy *sort of) The complaints seem real and the responses genuine as far as I could tell. I have since watched it and still find the humor. I was more curious about how long the show would last since they covered the main question of infidelity? The second season I am sure covered another topic, but I don't really remember. I do hope they put out the second season just so I can complete my thoughts on the show. All in all I did enjoy it when I was single and when I got into a serious relationship.\",\n",
              " b\"It aired on TV yesterday, so I decided to check it out. This was one of the last Bruce Timm/Paul Dini DTV projects related to their old 1992 Batman the Animated Series, after that Jeff Matsuda came along and re-imagined Batman with his new The Batman series, but anyway, the story of this new Batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as Batwoman, however Batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods, and also in the meantime take down The Pengiun and Ruphert Thorn who both are secretly working with Carlton Duquesne(who's having family troubles) and another villain(which is later revealed in the movie) on a weapons smuggling operation,they also put a bounty on the Batwoman. The question is: who is this mysterious Batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one? It's up to Batman to solve this mystery and stop Penguin's latest operation. For an animated movie, it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone, which is good. Another plus was the complete redesign of the Penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated Mob Boss we're used to seeing in the comics, unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from Tim Burton vision of Pengium(sewer rat and circus freak). Even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say, Batman Forever. The voice acting is standard quality for these direct-to-video projects(if only Batman: Mask of Phantasm took this route), Kevin Conroy still shines as Batman/Bruce Wayne. And like I said despite running for some very short 80 minutes, it manages to make a pretty good(and complex) storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action. There are a few downsides, however, Nightwing is nowhere to be seen, and I'm sure Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne don't click as a couple, even though is just referenced, Tim Drake(aka Robin) does very little in the movie and to be quite frank, I was never a big fan of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Batman character design(especially in their Batman shows post-BTAS), this The New Adventures of Batman and Robin, well, it kinda makes Batman look fat then rather a well-built bulked up individual(kinda like the Jeff Matsuda character model from The Batman). Bruce Wayne seems a bit awkward, those blue eyes make him look more like Clark Kent then Bruce(though it's true they do look very much alike). Another downside is Rupert Throne(no explanation as to why he is in this deal, but it's safe to say he's has goons and what's a cut of the deal) which does very little more then hang out with the Penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone(count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised. Overall, a good Batman animated movie, worth at least a rental.\",\n",

With the Dentist, they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller. This film came right on time actually. The decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far. I'm not at all saying this IS a masterpiece, but it's a nice change. Corbin Bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene. I remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor, but he can sure handle a psychotic character. The rest of the cast does good work too. The woman who plays Feinstone's wife is really attractive. Also, it was great to see Ken Foree acting again. The actor from my all time favorite movie Dawn of the Dead plays the cop in this film. Yuzna casted him in From Beyond too, 15 years ago and I thank him for that. I don't recommend this movie to everyone (if you have a weak stomach, I'll advise you to skip it) but if you do watch it, you'll enjoy it very much. You'll be disgusted...but that's an extra reason, I think. It's been a while since I was really freaked out by watching a film. It's a great topic to handle in the genre and Yuzna does it in a great way. Too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel. My humble opinion on the Dentist ... 8/10\",\n",

Now that he\\'s become his real self (which is strong and masculine) he falls in love with Loy. But she\\'s planning to divorce him...so he has to win her all over again. And deal with his past as a gangster.<br /><br />Very funny movie. Fast-moving, well-directed and acted...but it\\'s all because of Loy and Powell. Those two were absolutely incredible on-screen--they played off each other brilliantly and their quick, non-stop dialogue and one-liners were just fantastic. I prefer this one over the \"Thin Man\" series they did--in the \"Thin Man\" they were always drinking and it was played for laughs!!! This one doesn\\'t have that. Unfortunately it also doesn\\'t have that adorable dog Asta.<br /><br />Still, this quick and lots of fun. An excellent Hollywood comedy that (strangely) is almost forgotten today. Well worth seeing.',\n",
              " b'Quite recently I watched a marvelous documentary on Australian exploitation cinema entitled \"Not Quite Hollywood: the True, Untold Story of Ozploitation\" \\xc2\\x96 which I highly recommend to anyone \\xc2\\x96 and it really stimulated me to track down a lot of titles I\\'ve never even heard about before. \"Snapshot\" is one of them; a peculiar psycho-thriller/melodrama hybrid that coincidentally came out shortly after the huge box office success of \"Halloween\" and thus had to be re-titled \"The Day After Halloween\" in order to make extra money and cash in on the success of John Carpenter\\'s classic. Obviously this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Halloween, Michael Myers or Haddonfield and hopefully not too many people will be beguiled by this cheap marketing scam. I\\'m not even too sure \"Snapshot\" fully qualifies as horror, since the film barely features any genuine moments of fright. Despite the still relatively low number of independent cult movies produced in Australia around that time, \"Snapshot\" is an adequate and professional accomplishment with proper production values, respectable performances and ambitious story contents. Heck, the film is so ambitious that the drama overrules and the thriller elements never really even come through. \"Snapshot\" is much more of a satiric portrait of the sleazy and dishonest advertising/modeling industry than it is a nail-biting suspense thriller. Director Simon Wincer (\"Harlequin\", \"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\") seemingly never ceases to enlarge the melodramatic universe surrounding the main character Angela, but actually there\\'s very few action. 19-year-old Angela is lurid into shooting a topless modeling ad by an eloquent and she promptly gets offered a job as the face of a perfume brand. Angela is very enthusiast and moves in with her photographer, especially since she\\'s tired of her domineering mother and dead-end job at the hair dresser salon. She rapidly adapts to her new classy life and doesn\\'t even have to bother anymore about her stalking ex-boyfriend and his (not-so) inconspicuous ice cream van. However, she learns this is predominantly a rotten world full of greed, betrayal, false promises, sexual harassment, blackmail and danger. As said, \"Snapshot\" is a plain straightforward coming-of-age drama falsely advertised as a genuine horror movie. There are two noteworthy sequences near the very end, but they hardly seem worth waiting for. This could be an interesting and compelling viewing experience, but then you better know beforehand to expect a serious-toned film instead of a brainless slasher imitation.',\n",

It\\'s not the worst movie ever made, but it might be the worst movie ever made about vengeful frogs. One is only left pondering whether Milland bothered to save ANY money from his heyday as a movie star in the 40s and 50s. This guy actually won an Oscar in his early days!

About the only reason I went to see it was because it had been promoted heavily as a karate movie, and martial arts films were quite big at the time. What I got instead was three hours of 60's left wing political Bee-Ess served up with a massive dose of self-righteousness. Naturally, the hippie school was the embodiment of everything good and wonderful while The Establishment (meaning; everyone and everything else) was shown as being corrupt, venal, sadistic, and without any positive qualities at all. There was absolutely NO attempt at subtlety or evenhandedness here, instead, this movie grabs you by the throat and shoves your face into its one-dimensional worldview. In short, what ruins this film is its relentless preachiness, that, plus the fact that it so quickly became dated.

              " b\"Sharp, well-made documentary focusing on Mardi Gras beads. I have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex, and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home.<br /><br />I am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and globalism's effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it). Rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox (not that there's anything wrong with that, other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras beads, how they are manufactured, by what people, and under what conditions, and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process. It openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, American importers, and finally, the consumer at the end of the chain.<br /><br />I felt a little sickened by this; equally by the Mardi Gras revelers, but also by the way the workers in China have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). The footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end, made a particular impression. But that was just my reaction; I can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently.<br /><br />Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this. This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume. If you have ever bought a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to think about.<br /><br />Outstanding and highly recommended. Need to see more documentaries like this. Kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film.\",\n",
              " b\"The only thing this movie lacks from is more mainstream actors but would a mainstream studio publish this movie? Love it or hate it, this is a movie made for an audience of African descent with the intentions of bridging the gap between both sides of the Atlantic while simultaneously forcing African Americans to question their ways and identity. The perspective of the film maker can be questioned. One could complain that slave owners and Christianity was portrayed in too brutal of a light, as many of the other viewers have done. But must a film produced to explore the dehumanizing aspects of slavery along with the attempts by the slaves to reclaim their humanity also be one that reconciles the image of the enslavers? Of course not. This film was not published in a bubble. It is a part of a larger canon of slavery films, many of which have already highlighted the benevolence or at least mixed feelings of the master (see Roots, the Patriot by Mel Gibson, or even worse Jefferson in Paris).<br /><br />In all, this film was a brave attempt at complex and fairly unveiled aspects of slavery. It has its flaws but the biggest flaw is that many of these topics still go unrepresented on the big screen. Imagine how amazing a film of Nat Turner's Rebellion or the Hatian Revolt would be?\",\n",

This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while \"Home Alone 2\" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.<br /><br />You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie\\'s one flaw (the prince\\'s spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn\\'t that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let\\'s look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who\\'s more human than the movie\\'s medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who\\'s PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.<br /><br />The movie\\'s also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I\\'ve ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken\\'s score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it\\'s the movie\\'s very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche \"You\\'ll laugh, you\\'ll cry\" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called \\'classic\\' don\\'t deserve that appellation, but this one does.<br /><br />I\\'ll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one \"Beauty and the Beast\" is worth a thousand \"Akira\"s. And \"Shrek\"s. And, I\\'m willing to bet, \"Treasure Planet\"s. This is a truly adult animated feature that\\'s also one for the entire family.

Your sympathy is with them, you want them to succeed, probably for no other reason than you feel no common ground with the folks trying to stop them. The gold was being used to pay for a pointless war.<br /><br />Connery was pretty good here, trying to move beyond his James Bond persona, yet not quite escaping it. Donald Sutherland was a bit over the top, but still quite enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The film drags in places, but that's probably just a modern bias against 70's films, which didn't fill every space with CGI carnage.\",\n",

It\\'s a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.<br /><br />The casting of the boy Oliver doesn\\'t help matters: tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, there\\'s something less than solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes he\\'s obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.<br /><br />\"As Long As He Needs Me\" is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. The two big production numbers, \"Who Will Buy\" and \"Consider Yourself\" seem over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It\\'s one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess. <br /><br />The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess I have trouble with Mr. Dickens\\' consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /><br />Not all the combined talent of this production, either on- or behind camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material.

              " b\"Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...<br /><br />Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I'm not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.<br /><br />In a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.<br /><br />Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.\",\n",
              " b'This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time. For one, it has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain, brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters. The plot, about mistaken identity, payroll robbery and murder, is as trite and perfunctory as you\\'d expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western, but Wayne\\'s strapping good looks, easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. Plump, balding Eddy Chandler isn\\'t quite believable as Wayne\\'s womanizing \"partner\", and there\\'s a running gag about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. On the other hand, Wayne\\'s love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman, the little \"Mary\" of the early \"Little Rascals\" fame. She is a grown-up 20-year-old now, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne\\'s leading ladies in these Lone Star/Monogram \"B\\'s\" were fairly bland and colorless, but Mary is perky, cute and, yes, sexy. There\\'s a scene in the general store, where she works, in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of \"nerve tonic\", which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. Wayne\\'s ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps, then again as she comes down, then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. Wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. Anyway, it\\'s an interesting little \"B\", not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The final gunfight isn\\'t handled all that well, and Chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while, but all in all, it\\'s worth a look, if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.',\n",

Choregoraphy - especially with the police in the second act was first class. A couple of minor quibbles - not sure why it was necessary to bring in the trio from Ruddigore - it seems fashionable these days to \"cross-dress\" so to speak and although this actually worked quite well it wasn\\'t really necessary. The Swinglettes as a take off of the Andrews Sisters was superb but unfortunately it also meant that Edith was hardly distinguishable from the rest of the daughters when she has a decent part in the original score. Minor points, though, you could hear the audience absolutely loving it and it kept far enough on the traditional side of the line without being stuffy - Gilbert may have shuffled uncomfortably in his grave but he would not, I think, have turned right over.

              " b\"Vampires Anonymous starts in Los Angeles where Vampire Vic Weller (Paul Popowich) needs help controlling his addiction to blood so he calls Vampires Anonymous who run a twelve step program for Vampires. A program designed to make Vampires not want to drink human blood & be there if they need help or are having trouble, the first step is apparently to 'admit you have a problem' & ends with 'smile, your a winner!' although there's lots of hard work & temptation to overcome between. Vic gets packed of to Rock Creek, North Carolina where he has to blend in with the locals & feed on the blood of sheep but Vic finds it hard to suppress the Vampire within himself...<br /><br />Co-written, co-produced & directed by Michael Keller I have to say right off the bat that I hated Vampires Anonymous., of course this is just my opinion & I'm in no way saying that you will definitely hate it but I think there's a fair chance the majority of potential viewers will find much more to hate in Vampires Anonymous than like. The script by Keller & J.P. Srinivasan is the biggest problem here, again this is just my opinion but I thought it was terrible. Vampires Anonymous is supposed to be some sort of light hearted comedy horror romance with a pinch of biting satire about therapy groups & psychiatric help thrown in there for good (bad?) measure. If that basic story outline makes you laugh then you may enjoy Vampires Anonymous but I thought it was an awful attempt at trying to be clever & funny & different, Vampires Anonymous is one of the most unfunny comedies I've ever seen & the makers can't even pull off a good sheep shagging farmer joke. The genre of horror comedy is very hard to pull off & the makers of this fail in spectacular fashion, the horror elements are none existent, the romance is so cheesy & predictable I almost threw up & it took me four sittings of twenty odd minutes each to get through this because I literally couldn't get through it one go.<br /><br />Director Keller turns in a competent film & that's the only reason this turd gets two stars out of ten rather than one. It's not scary, it's definitely not funny, there's no tension, it's utterly predictable, the story is all over the place, the character's are unlikable, the dialogue sucks & I found it a real chore to sit through. I didn't like it. At all. Forget about any gore, there's a couple of neck bitings & a bit of blood drinking otherwise nothing. No nudity either. According to the closing credits Vampires Anonymous was edited by the interesting named Farm Dog, either that it was was literally edited by a farm dog.<br /><br />Technically the film is fine & is really the only positive aspect of it but since it sucks so bad in every other way does it really matter? Shot in Burlington in North Carolina apparently, I doubt this is going to do much for the tourist numbers though. I have some advice for Michael Madsen, get a new agent considering some of the crap he's been in. I mean from the classy Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) to this as his next film?! Having said that the quotes 'I probably made a few pictures I shouldn't have done, but I have four sons and I have to pay the rent. If you have a decision to make about whether or not you can buy groceries at the market or whether or not you're going to make a bad movie, you're going to make a bad movie.' & 'My career has been very strange. My career is like a heart monitor. I get involved in a good project now and then to keep things going. And then I make things that I work on that I hope are going to be good so I can make a living and keep a roof over the heads of those little monsters I have in my house. You know, every movie you make can't be great, no matter who you are. Even Brando made some clinkers.' from his page on the IMDb explains why he makes rubbish like Vampires Anonymous. We all have to pay the rent I suppose.<br /><br />Vampires Anonymous sucks as much as the Vampires in the film, I'm sorry but I really disliked every aspect of the story & found it so unfunny & moronic it's untrue.

              " b'I grew up a fan of The Three Stooges...basically thinking that there was \"no other comedy prior to 1960 besides them\". Since that time, I still believe the Stooges, especially Shemp-era material, is the greatest comedy of all time. In the 1990\\'s I came to appreciate the genius of Tim Moore & Spencer Williams. I have almost every episode of \"The Amos \\'n\\' Andy Show\" and now consider them just a hair below the Stooges in terms of comic creativity.<br /><br />Honesty needs to come into play here as I reveal that I had never seen a full W.C. Fields short or feature in my life prior to this year. My introduction to him was \"The Fatal Glass Of Beer\" and I am amazed at this short! Whereas most of the clips that I had ever seen of Fields turned me off from ever wanting to see anything else, this short makes me want to view his entire body of work.<br /><br />If I had to make a short, this is probably what it would turn out to be like!',\n",

Well, the Gor books, for those of you who haven\\'t had the pleasure, or pain, can be summed up as follows: Conan with pornography. Each and every novel was chock full of porn, sado-masochism and bondage. In short, a \"raging-hormone-male-teenager\\'s\" wet dream. Hidden amongst the sleaze and thinly-veiled attempts to make the reader think of women as nothing but objects, there are actually some pretty good action-adventure stories. So it would seem that converting them to celluloid would be a winner, even if only on the soft-porn circuit.<br /><br />Sadly, Outlaw of Gor is nothing like the books. Given my description above, some might breathe a sigh of relief at that. Unfortunately, by taking away the sex, having a budget less than that of the average teenager\\'s weekly pocket money and doing some awful re-inventing of the novels\\' original ideas (yes there were some!), the filmmakers literally killed the golden goose and replaced it with a prize turkey.<br /><br />Outlaw is just horrendous throughout, from the acting, the sets, the laughable \"costumes\", the editing and dialogue right down to the fight scenes that appeared to have been choreographed by the Marx Bros. But the worst thing is seeing how little they used the original material. Nevermind the porn, they plucked names out of the books and didn\\'t do a whole lot else. Tarl Cabot, the hero of the novels, is translated into a weedy vegetarian who is totally against slavery - a complete reversal from the novels. Likewise the Priest-Kings - In the books alien insectoids who ruled the planet. In the movie we get.....Jack Palance, who doesn\\'t seem to be in command of his own lines, let alone the planet. And yes, Jack leers and mugs his way throughout the movie, at least having the grace to look embarrassed at several points.<br /><br />The plot is feeble, centering around an evil Queen\\'s attempts to take control of the city of Koroba by murdering her husband and blaming it on Cabot. There then follows interminable amounts of wandering about in the desert by Cabot and his midget henchman (I kid you not!). We\\'re also treated to far too many shots of the midget\\'s rear end during the film (I mentioned the costumes were rubbish, didn\\'t I?) and awful moralising dialogue by Cabot about the evils of slavery.<br /><br />There are no special effects to speak of - the budget was too miniscule for that, just the heady excitement of one lame swordfight after another. At the end, which really sums up the whole movie and had me in hysterics, Tarl Cabot makes as if to snap his sword over his knee - a symbolic gesture of peace. Would have been good too, except that the sword does not break - it bends into a U shape like it was made out of thin tin. Yep, that\\'s Outlaw of Gor for ya - all bent out of shape.<br /><br />Even on MST3K this is one of the lamest excuses for a movie. It really is best avoided.',\n",

The main characters is totally uninteresting and is relatively indestructible, so there\\'s no reason to have any anticipation what-so-ever.<br /><br />The story is rather stupid as well, centering around the discovery of Noah\\'s Ark. Apart from that the movie involves many explosions, graphic deaths, and more explosions.<br /><br />What adds insult to injury is the animation. While rather good and relatively fluid, it shows that more money went into making a lousy movie look good than actually starting out with a decent movie in the first place. Polish a turd and it\\'s still a turd. Also, if you\\'re looking for something along the lines of Akira animation, look elsewhere as this movie has none of the style, daring use of lighting and color, or technique that Akira pioneered.<br /><br />Another rather bothersome element is the terrible voice acting done by the child in the movie. While original voice actors are always superior to a dubbed voice, I don\\'t see how a dubbed voice could sound more \"mechanical\" or \"forced\" than that child did.<br /><br />This movie appeals to the lowest common factor in people.

A young Robert Stack is in the movie and there are some very touching moments.<br /><br />Too bad it wasn't on DVD.

I ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because I simply didn't want to subject my mind to it any more. There is far too much sex in the film. Sex can be okay; it can even make the movie (hence Karma Sutra) but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Don't see this film.\",\n",
              " b\"But still a disappointment. Let's look back to the original film for a moment. Overall, not much dialogue. The humor was scarce but touching, the fawns a picture of innocence. Now take a look at Bambi 2. A lot of unnecessary yapping in between cheesy pop songs. Some of cute moments, some jokes reused from the original, and the movie even has its fair share of toilet humor. The fawns are now rambunctious and argumentative, at points even fighting with each other.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying that Bambi 2 has to be a carbon copy of the original, but shouldn't it at least possess a similar tone? There were many things I did like about this movie- the animation was spectacular, and the movie was, overall, pretty sweet. The original movie had a style that's hard to emulate, I'll admit. And hey, toddlers will probably pay attention to this one much longer than the first.<br /><br />However, in history, there are some films that just shouldn't be touched. Cinderella? Aladdin? Okay. But Bambi 2, as entertaining as it was, left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. However, for what it's worth (a cheap, straight to DVD release), I guess I can't complain.\",\n",

Indeed there is no complicated plot, no big action scenes and a predictable ending but there is a Story. It's Andrew with his Box of Chocolats, simply going through life searching for what eludes him and what we generally take for granted - humanity. The characters along the way are well acted - in particular the robot creator and his ditsy assistant. This movie is a tear jerker as Andrew's friends come and go and lifetimes pass him by without him really comprehending it all. The only real failings were the large gaps in time and how Andrew came about - but then it's difficult to compress 200 years into 1 1/2 hours. If you enjoyed Azimov's books as much as I did, then this movie is for you. Far better in my opinion than IA or I Robot who also took their cues from Azimov.\",\n",

One watches stunned, incredulous, and possibly deranged, as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie actually exist, or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company, sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of films, and a lot of bad films, but nothing prepared me for this; by the end of it I was a gibbering, snivelling wreck, tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog, clawing at the walls, howling till my lungs were sore. I pleaded desperately, frenziedly for mercy (to whom this appeal was made, I don't know), and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Weeping Jesus, the memories... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm at my most vulnerable, when I'm least able to handle them. I shudder, I break down in tears, I bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood, but I can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a shell of a man.<br /><br />The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist, or b) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite mind-boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal, or at least have not been left traumatised by it. Perhaps they're part of the operation. God damn them, the maniacs!

              " b'I honestly feel that this is a great Godzilla film in many ways; but the negative comments written on reflection by some viewers are difficult to dismiss. Many of the negative reviews of \"G.: Final Wars\" reflect a frustration with that film\\'s radical revision of the very look and feel of the series. Here, the problem is that, despite innovations, \"G. 2000\" remains narratively and stylistically bound to the traditional series, but can\\'t quite deliver the goods some fans expected of it. This bodes ill for the whole \"millenium\" series that follows, and indicates why this Godzilla series, while developing a cult of its own, lost the interest of many older fans.<br /><br />I\\'ll approach this by remarking an important point that, oddly, many missed, reflected in the American audio commentary to the US DVD version of the film. What astounded me, right at the beginning of the film, was that the Americans involved in the loop and re-edit of the US release had not the slightest clue that a great deal of the humor of the film develops by spoofing the wretched American \"Godzilla\" (-in-name-only, or GINO) of 1998; The opening has Godzilla at a light-house, not only as a tribute to the granddaddy of post-WWII dinosaur flicks, \"Beast from 20,000 Fanthoms\", but because \"Beast is the film the American GINO was really remaking. This is quickly followed by a confrontation between our human protagonists and Godzilla in a roadway tunnel - clearly a comment, and spoof, on the tunnel sequence that ends the GINO film. Little digs at GINO pepper the whole film; and along with them, back-handed comments on the previous Godzilla series of the \\'80s and \\'90s.<br /><br />Visually, something odd is going on here, and I don\\'t mean the new Godzilla suit some have a difficulty with; actually, performed well and photographed from the right angles, it can be very impressive.<br /><br />What\\'s happening is in the background, but it shapes the whole look of the film. With the enormous development and reconstruction of Tokyo over the past few decades, the city has literally shot up, with enormous skyscrapers tossed together with every little over-all urban design. Let\\'s face it - these buildings very nearly dwarf Godzilla; although technically larger than ever before in the series, he looks smaller because of the urban growth he has to wade through. This also accounts for some of the higher-angled placements of the camera, which have the audience looking down on Godzilla (without the jet or helicopter POV as in previous films).<br /><br />The fact is, the world around Godzilla is becoming ever more complicated; the film-makers are pretty savvy about it, but many audiences, although more sophisticated about such matters than they were in the 1960s, clearly feel uncomfortable with even minor renovations in the series, since these frequently reduce Godzilla in stature, in comparison with the legendary city-stomper of old.<br /><br />As for me, I really like the characters; I find the special effects impressive and the story engaging. And from what I have in the American re-release, I think the film-makers did a pretty good job over-all.<br /><br />Maybe the reason Toho decided to retire the character is because they had to; maybe the era of Godzilla is over and it\\'s time to find new monsters and new heroes. Too bad; it was a pretty good era for vinyl puppet monsters and invasions from outer space. In that regard it was truly a fun ride, and if it is indeed over, I will miss the best of it.',\n",

The failed attempts at humor in the film are far more likely to make viewers shake their heads in disbelief than cause them to laugh. In fact, this film frequently has this effect on any viewer who can manage to sit through the whole thing.

I say, save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will Christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear (huh? criminals say bad words?) and flat characters I really could not relate to.

Of course Pesci was great - the woman in it, Marissa Tomei not only was quick, witty, gorgeous, but acted the part easily - and I think was the #1 actor in the movie. There's no doubt that My Cousin Vinny will be my favorite repeat picture in my library.

I watch a load of independent movies, many with budgets much lower than this film had, and I have yet to see such a badly written, badly directed, badly made and woefully badly acted dud as this. The film is as unfocused as it is unbelievable and veers off on side plots that contribute nothing to the main storyline.<br /><br />And Justin Herwick is a good actor in the lead role? Please don\\'t make me laugh. Are you friends of his or something? His emotions do not change a single time throughout the entire film and he mumbles his way through all of his dialogue as if he could care less. I\\'ve never seen such an inept and lazy performance in my entire life and it\\'s one of the main things that completely ruin this film. It\\'s as if the actor thought he could cruise on his looks alone. Sad thing is, he isn\\'t all that in the first place and you have NO clue why everyone in this movie is in love with him. He\\'s not very bright, average looking, self-absorbed, incredibly boring and slutty; your typically dumb airhead club kid type. Yet everyone in this movie is falling all over him as if he\\'s either a drop dead gorgeous and/or fascinating person. Please!<br /><br />But of course there\\'s a heavy-handed moral to the story after most of the running time has been used up basically showing a bunch of guys parading around naked, useless subplots that exist basically to show even more nudity and people spitting out laughably angsty dialogue (a part where one character compares love to 9 miles of intestines in the human body is about the worst attempt at \"deep\" dialogue I\\'ve ever heard). The horribly conceived \"it\\'s time to grow up\" moment in question though is when Sam (Shane Powers), a friend of Jacksons, kills himself because he\\'s also secretly in love with him! I guess at this moment, almost at the very end of the movie, we\\'re suddenly supposed to sympathize with Jackson.

The subplot involving Marini\\'s gay brother\\'s desperation over unrequited love for an imprisoned stud (which is all magically settled by the end) is merely boring. Really, the only attention-grabbing element - apart from Marini herself, that is - is the score; the pet goats are cute, too.

In a word, like the previous years Hound of the Baskervilles, it was remarkably MISCAST.

The States got it in syndication about a year post-production and was heavily marketed initially for the 1975-76 season.<br /><br />The show got a lot of stick for its questionable science and uneven writing, but it was a nice break from other action shows masquerading as sci-fi. Remember, it is science FICTION. Unresolved endings and dark story lines were the trademark of the first season while the second series succumbed to safer familiar territory. One can point to the unexplained changes in Season Two as show killers, but I think people who latched on to this simply wanted another \"Star Trek\" and were disappointed.<br /><br />I wasn\\'t disappointed ... I found the stories fresh, realistic, and full of literary references that fleshed out the scripts rather than purloined as borrowed lines uttered by the actors.<br /><br />The main idea built around the premise of the moon forcibly ejected from the earth\\'s orbit was a risky move, and I suppose many viewers thought this too ridiculous, therefore I wonder if an episode, a continuation of the pilot episode, that picks up the events befalling earth below simultaneously was in order. Perhaps that idea was kicked around but rejected because of similarities to Irwin Allen\\'s disaster flicks of the time, budget constraints, the lack of a script, or the fact that the series was about space, not earth. Whatever, I think that would\\'ve been the link that might have clinched this series for a longer run.<br /><br />Some of my favorites include \"Dragon\\'s Domain\", \"Force of Life\", \"Black Sun\", \"Earthbound\", and \"Death\\'s Other Dominion\".

Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. Lancaster over acts to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. It seems like the 1950\\'s was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didn\\'t make too many of them. Despite an A-list cast and good production values, it doesn\\'t work.',\n",
              " b'Parker and Stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze. Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humour and homilies from the heart.<br /><br />If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us \"Airplane\" and the \"Naked Gun\" series. This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since \"Bullitt\" and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can, but one must admit he\\'s perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.<br /><br />For those who haven\\'t noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics. This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. As usual, they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA.<br /><br />A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone\\'s rampaging pair of Cartmans.<br /><br />In summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the \"Naked Gun/Airplane\" formula. Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant (or absolutely awful) if given full control over a future film. America, either lock these guys up or put them in charge.',\n",

This movie tells the story of a girl who must disguise herself as a boy in order to get a job so her family can buy food. If she is caught, she would most likely be put to death for breaking the law. It is amazing that such things still exist in today's world. This movie is a warning that there must be no more regimes such as the Taliban in Afghanistan.

If you ever made silly home movies with friends on your mom's camera when you were young, it was probably on this level (the only difference being that they had about $50 more to spend than you did). This movie should have remained an inside joke between friends and never seen the light of day. Note: I'm not pretentious, I own and enjoy lots of B movies.

In fact, I would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that I have yet seen and, believe me, I have seen plenty (especially in the last few years i.e. following my excursion to the 2004 Venice Film Festival)! Reading about how the film\\'s failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director\\'s subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore, I can see their point: I may prefer Fulci\\'s earlier \"giallo\" period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but, even on the latter, his commitment was arguably unquestionable. On the other hand, CONQUEST seems not to have inspired Fulci in the least \\xc2\\x96 seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist, sprinkle it with incongruent characters (cannibals vs. werewolves, anyone?), irrelevant gore (we are treated to a gratuitous, nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists!) and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked, brain-slurping villainess (don\\'t ask) and her slimy reptilian pet!! For what it is worth, we have two heroes for the price of one here: a young magic bow-carrying boy on some manhood-affirming odyssey (Andrea Occhipinti) and his rambling muscle-bound companion (Jorge Rivero i.e. Frenchy from Howard Hawks\\' RIO LOBO [1970]!) who, despite being called Mace (short for Maciste, perhaps?), seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 out of trouble (particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the \\'boils\\'). Unfortunately, even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti\\'s electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times.

The audience gets a glimpse into the lives of a privileged set of college aged \"preppy\" Manhattan-ites. Lots of fun music helps keep the scenes jaunty and most of the actors are well cast.<br /><br />The film while intellectual in bent, plays most of the scenes decidedly tongue in cheek which keeps the movie from feeling pretentious.<br /><br />The movie is a baby Hannah and Her Sisters if you will.

Beyond that skill, there's her transference to the character, Sophie, and to the main test as an actress, the absorption of the unspeakable atmosphere of a place -- the camp at Auschwitz -- of wholesale pain, indescribable humiliation, and the final acceptance of death of her child to save another.

First things first: this movie is one of those In Name Only sequels... and has practically nothing to do with the original classic. It hasn't got the same writer, director, actors or even the same style. This film is of a distinctly lesser quality in every respect. (This movie has some of the absolute WORST, fakest fight choreography I have ever seen!) Neil Giuntoli stands in this time for Michael Rooker (the original Henry) and, while he has a couple of effective scenes of underlying, stoic menace, for the most part he doesn't make much of an impression. This time around Henry is on his own and looking for work. He gets a job cleaning and moving port-a-potties and makes fast friends with a co-worker, Kai (Rich Komenich). Kai and his very un-happy-looking but smolderingly sensuous wife (Kate Walsh) invite Henry to stay with them until he gets some money put together. They also have an emotionally unstable niece (Carri Levinson) who draws freaky pictures. You think, with the two women in the house making googly eyes at Henry and carrying all that emotional baggage, that the tension would escalate into something really interesting. Well, you'd be wrong. Instead, Henry finds out that Kai does arson jobs for extra cash and the two of them get sidetracked into burning down old buildings for awhile. Then Henry starts into his killing spree again, slowly involving Kai more and more. The finale is a big disappointment in all respects... hardly touching on some of the more interesting elements introduced earlier in the movie. No wonder that there hasn't been a Henry 3.\",\n",

Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it?! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the BETTER episodes!! After many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the live-action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy-Doo--since practically everyone hates him!',\n",

The main problem is that the gaming area is absolutely immense. While this may be a good thing (a whole state is your gaming area in the upcoming GTA: San Andreas) there are very few definitive landmarks to give you some kind of orientation. It's based on the real New York, with all the famous buildings, but literally hundreds of streets look the same and it's very, very easy to get hopelessly lost.

Yes, it's cool, but very slow considering the area you have to cover and not to easy to control unless your a genius with the control pad.<br /><br />And the missions are all the same. Stop an armoured car hijack, stop a guy stealing a car, save some idiot hanging off a building, beating up nameless thugs, save some guy hanging off a building, stop some guy stealing a car, save some guy hanging off a building...boring.

              " b'I\\'ve never written an IMDb review before, but at the insistence of director John Stimpson I will tell the world my feelings.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Stimpson\\'s lack of choices make for a confused genre film that doesn\\'t know if it wants to be a murder mystery, ghost story or horror film. Combining these three fields weigh the film down causing it to stumble over its own shoddy progression.<br /><br />The acting is undeniably sophomoric even from the veterans that populate the screen. They careen through the film as if making a TV movie of the week. The frequent chuckles I heard from the surrounding audience makes me feel as if I\\'m not alone in my thinking. There is way to much running through the woods screaming. At one point I was hoping Robert Stack would emerge and ask for any information to the where-abouts of Lucy Keyes.<br /><br />The direction is stilted and stiff. The use of hand held is meant to loosen up and flow with the characters, but feels instead like a contrived way of convincing the audience that the film is tense. Stimpson\\'s film feels like oh so many movies I\\'ve watched by 15 year-olds, self- important and lackluster. <br /><br />The script is amateur in every way; from the Cray paper thin plot to the use of swear words. Robert Towne spoke of his film the Last Detail\\'s use of vulgarity as a substitute for action. Here, Lucy Keyes uses swearing as a substitute for naturalism. Stimpson believes that if the parents cut loose and let an F-Bomb fly they\\'ll be more human and believable. Instead, each curse reminds me that I\\'m watching the most pedestrian of film-making.<br /><br />As something that wants to be a ghost story, horror film and murder mystery the film lacks any scares other than cheap \"jump\" scares. The lack of atmosphere in the supposed tense portions of the film makes for a laughable movie. It also diffuses the overall tone making the film feel muddled and unfocused. How anyone could find this film scary is beyond my understanding. The Nickelodeon television series Are You Afraid of The Dark is much scarier and has no use for severed pigs heads.<br /><br />Technically the film is just above competent. The photography is nothing special, I believe this is because Stimpson made no choices in preproduction so as to color correct it later. This leaves the photographic images flat and undynamic. Nighttime is blue, daytime warm. The editing is uninspired. Its mostly an offender of the editor\\'s \"band-aid\" using dissolves and fades to black in an over abundance. The crude use of these fades to black feels more like an area for a commercial break, unfortunately none came. I could\\'ve used even the most terrible of commercials to break my boredom with this film.<br /><br />What does one do with a film like this? Television? I wouldn\\'t force this on even the most unassuming Lifetime Television watcher. The castration of dignity Lifetime would do to a film like this may be fitting, but even that audience would be pained watching this film. DVD? Maybe, but what\\'s the point? Lucy Keyes should prepare for a long shelf life.',\n",

              " b'Imagine the perfectionist forms Kurosawa had achieved with samurai epics, Ford and Lean with lyrical, volatile nature, Tarkosvky and Bresson with the spiritual-bound outer space or dinky office desks of priests and cops, then add a too-generous wallop of Clouzot\\'s suffocating suspense flooding from the dark recess of human nature - and King Hu\\'s universe of the Wuxia STILL has plenty of its own identity left! This is truly groundbreaking in every way, in context of envisioning the worlds of Jiang Hu, civilian life, elite politics, and spiritual dissidents.<br /><br />A previous comment noted \"A Touch of Zen\" as a \"minor masterpiece\" next to its Japanese contemporaries, which is as ethnocentric as saying Asian films deserves such broad-sweeping generalization DESPITE their completely different context of cosmology, specific relations and development of individual and social structure, etc., even given the surface similarities of skin color, religious practice, select cultural affinity, and more. <br /><br />(For example, what\\'s the value in judging Billy Wilder\\'s best _at the expense of_ those by Ernst Lubitsch, or vice versa, simply because both had Germanic backgrounds and exiled to America and excelled at witty romantic comedy? They operated in rather different production settings, cultural milieu, sources of inspiration, etc.)<br /><br />Back to \"Zen\". Forget all the hierarchies of Taoism, Confucianism some elite reviews want to force upon the film. Just watch what\\'s really on screen: a well-mapped structure is charting the course of violence itself. See bookish nerd get inducted in the ways of bloodshed, see that self-congratulatory reflecting its power-hungry society collapse, and finally see that collective last gasp sacrifice its own young - in vain of any redemption. <br /><br />The ending is less about Buddha (in fact THROUGHOUT the whole film when characters\\' gaze perpetually hint at a mythic, towering world order and all-enveloping consciousness larger than their conflicts or King Hu could cram on screen), than such spiritual path as critique of all the commotions that preceded it - and made up the film. Hu\\'s remarkable balance of nihilism and transcendent possibilities, are pretty much the same aspirations of the increasingly personal film-making in 60s/70s America, Europe, and Japan. It\\'s also astounding to see Hu reach in the same epic manner this conclusion, more than a decade before the venerable Kurosawa\\'s \"old man\\'s lament\" in \"Ran\".<br /><br />A last note: \"A Touch of Zen\" may rub fans of the usual wuxiapian the wrong way, since its artistic ambitions are a bit more personal than regaling the audience-as-king. There are no immediate gratifications (not even Hitchcock at his bleakest or Clouzot teased viewers for 45 minutes straight without rewards!) And even when they occur, the style is often serving the story and Hu\\'s point (i.e. bamboo scene is NOT for pure thrill of spectacle so it\\'s shorter than the \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\" version; the \"too dark\" photography during ambush is setting up for \"nerd\\'s epiphany\" later.) So expect none and the experience will be more enriching.',\n",

              " b\"When I heard that Identity lends a lot of the Classic Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Niggers my curiosity was aroused. I like this novel very much, but never really saw a good presentation on film. This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts. It's quite suspenseful and keeps you wondering who the killer is. But there are little hints and another storyline that makes you suspect something else might be afoot.<br /><br />Then all of a sudden half way through the movie you're hit on the forehead with an enormous revelation and plot twist of almost `Sixth Sense' proportions. This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist. But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are anything between average and very good, but it's John Cusack, who seems to get better with each movie, again who really carries the movie. Both sound and vision are very well balanced to serve the mood of the story.<br /><br />So would I recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure? I would even with that extra twist at the end that spoiled it for me.\",\n",

In 2007 this sequel is released and it is one of these sequels that should have been released straight to DVD. It's almost a crime that films like this are being released to cinema, wasting valuable screen time.<br /><br />White Noise 2 starts when a guy has a near death experience and learns that he can see which people are to die soon by simply looking at them and checking them out. As he learns of this gift he starts to save them and as expected that is where everything goes wrong.<br /><br />This film fails on every single aspect: badly acted, badly predictable story, mismatched shock effects, no tension what so ever, and worst of all, a plot that blandly contradicts itself at various stages.<br /><br />3 out of 10 bored dead.\",\n",
              " b\"Cruel Intentions 2 is bloody awful, I mean uber-bad. Words can not explain how bad it is, but I'll give it a go anyway.<br /><br />The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first film. Sebastian (Robin Dunne), is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately he has to deal with his step-sister Kathryn (Amy Adams) wants to drag him down. Sebastain starts to fall in love Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the Headmaster of the school. Kathryn wants Sebastain to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a 'whore-house'. Kathryn also wants to get revenge with Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliated her during the school assembly. Kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school, a similar sub-plot to the first film.<br /><br />Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a cancelled TV-show, which was turned into a prequel. There are so many problems with the film. It is poorly written, unfunny, and badly acted. Luckily for Amy Adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress. Whilst Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon.co.uk 'a randy version of Saved by the Bell'. There were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film, but in Cruel Intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldn't be, such as Kathryn having an affair with a teacher. Other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students. The film also had a major problem of sexualised 15/16-years-old. I know that teenagers do have sex, sometimes a lot, but when done on film or television, is treated very seriously. One famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie (who is around 14/15 in the film) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm. The idea of turning a girl around 14/15 into a slut is just very wrong with me, and shouldn't be made into a subject of comedy. The jokes in the film fall flat, whether if it's a verbal gag like 'she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.<br /><br />There is a lot wrong with this film, which I don't have time to go into, but I say it should be avoid. Just watch Cruel Intentions, whilst not a classic, still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well.<br /><br />This film is just a pervert's wet dream, having school-kids having lots of sex with each other.\",\n",
              " b\"I'd have to say that this is easily my favorite movie of all time. it's a terrific parody of the inner workings of Hollywood, and it's backed up my absolutely amazing animation and special effects by Mr. Jittlov, who also does a wonderful job as the main character (himself), and the police dog. The producer does a good job acting as the producer (as he should!).<br /><br />Summary: See it! you'll like it! i promise.\",\n",
              " b'Great film! Some rather large plot holes that could have been easily avoided, if one were going to be honest, and at times the thing is frustratingly obscure and careless with logic. But Believers has a very creepy air, the acting is generally superb, and the ending is - if predictable a light year off - totally BRILLIANT. <br /><br />The movie plays like a very long episode of The Outer Limits (the 60s original, not the wretched colour revivals), and that\\'s no bad thing. I suspect this movie played better outside of the US - American audiences tend to like everything explained with a minimum of ambiguity, and this movie has a very cavalier attitude towards plot information. Bad plot flaws damage the overall impact - the incredibly half-hearted search for the paramedics, the far too swift \\'sex conversion\\' of the hero\\'s buddy, the unexplained resurrection of a woman cult member, the badly answered question of why the paramedics needed to be kidnapped at all etc. But, ahhh, I\\'ve seen A-films that have made worse mistakes.<br /><br />Believers is most effective in the little details...the ever present loud speakers in the compound, constantly burbling propaganda you can only half hear, the glassy expressions on the faces of the cult members, the fact that these weird people are scary because they are NOT overtly evil. Perhaps more important is the fact that, like the Leader with the hero, the movie never tries to convince you to believe in what is happening...you can take it or leave it on one level or another. Comparisons with Jonestown are obvious, but the film\\'s general tone owes a larger debt to the Aum Supreme Truth cult in Japan, with its\\' fetish for electronic devices and quasi-scientific esoterica, the usage of poison gas, and the idea that the charismatic leader holds a revealed \"indisputable truth\".<br /><br />Daniel Benzali is electrifying as \\'The Teacher\\', creating a sort of Colonel Kurtz character. The Quanta Group\\'s second in command, who appears at the start in the TV interview, and whose name eludes me, is also superb. Check out the deleted scenes on the DVD for moments featuring both men, both apparently improvised for the most part, that are better than anything kept in the movie. Puzzling omissions. The movie also contains one of the more chilling torture scenes in recent memory, in the shape of the electro-shock \\'purging\\' of the hero. Devoid of gore, this scene is made frightening (for me at least) by the complete lack of emotion shown by the torturers. \"It\\'s for your own good\" delivered in a weary monotone is far scarier than a truckload of Texas Chainsaw evil-chuckling over a victim.<br /><br />But *that* ending, a very erotic sex scene, the aforementioned EST torture moment, and a general air of weirdness and repressed hysteria, gives this film an edge. Well worth seeing.',\n",
              " b'This is a very silly film. All the female characters never walk or run or stand, they mince, flounce and languish. The lesbian vampires of the title are easily the most ineffectual vampires ever to grace the silver screen. This whole movie is just too European for me. And, while the lesbian vampires might have a taste for blood, there sure is very little of it in this film. All the above said, I did enjoy this film, because it is so easy to laugh about. About the only thing thing this so called erotic horror film is good for is a laugh.',\n",

A group of spoiled success types(..rock singer, newspaper columnist, television exec, celebrity cook, entertainment lawyer, high-maintenance slut)find themselves trapped in the isolated wings of the abandoned building after following a riddle to a properly prepared party by a psycho. The psycho haunts the rooms, hidden behind his prey who wander aimlessly trying to survive as he captures them one by one when certain individuals make the mistake of getting separated. Booby traps await equipped with riddles. A list containing the names of the group given an invite are labeled with specific titles(Kathy-loser, Nicole-heartless, Adam-pig, etc)and when each victim is dispatched a red X is marked through them. The killer\\'s weapon of choice is a hook. But, other methods of execution include used an ax splitting the forehead, end of a knife stabbing a hole in the neck, a sliced throat, heart removed from a chest with it beating in the killer\\'s hand(..not elaborated in grisly detail, the director uses sounds, only displaying the beating heart), the back of a victim\\'s head crushed repeatedly into the floor during a scuffle, and a vicious attack with a meat tenderizer. The gore-murders lack bite and slasher fans who watch this genre passionately will find them merely adequte. This is a rather tedious slasher with a lot of the film showing this group trying to find an exit while bickering with each other. The characters like to insult each other constantly, fighting often over superficial stuff..their antics are at times playful, other instances nasty. Regardless, the killer couldn\\'t plunge the hook into their gullets fast enough for me..but, alas, we spend a great deal of time longer with these sleazy egomaniacs which is unfortunate. There\\'s of course a twist(..does the killer have a partner in crime?), but \"Steel Trap\" is little more than a tired Saw retread set in a building that lacks atmosphere, no matter how often the lights blink on and off. The killer should be creepy, but he\\'s merely a walking kill-device whose motives for committing these acts is embarrassingly uninspired. Some slasher fans might get a kick out of who\\'s *really* behind this mind trap, as the film closes with a warped comic tone mimicking cooking shows. The riddles used in the film are corny instead of witty, leading the characters in a maze of doors and rooms with the killer knowing exactly where to strike almost at all times.',\n",

Secondly... what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of? And thirdly... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this, shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released. You really would have to search a very, very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this... and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which, inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is. The movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all.

But they taught me that God was love!).The best scene IMHO ,is the short dialog between priest John Heard -who does not seem to take things seriously ,too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid-back acting is priceless-and the young Jew.<br /><br />Demi Moore probably registered the same desire as ex-husband Bruce Willis :saving the world.She does not save the movie for all that.',\n",
              " b\"I have to admit, I was disappointed. It's pretty hard to go into films like these without pretty low expectations of the splatstick stuff you're going to be exposed to, but this came off like a cheap Suicide Club with imitations of Silence of the Lambs. Well, again, that sounds a lot more exciting than this movie was. Basically, the problem is you watch this movie to see a girl kick butt with a yoyo, and you get maybe ten minutes of that with a whole lot of random other stuff getting in the way.<br /><br />Not to argue with the writing. The dialog is pretty terrible, but actually the plot isn't half-bad if someone would have taken through a few more drafts and maybe even tried to make it either more serious or more silly than it is. Instead, it tries a little too hard to be both, and through Kenta Fukasaku's poor control of tone, ends up failing at both. Kenta has an eye for digital effects and making every edit seem like an exclamation mark, but he doesn't know when to sit back and let the story tell itself. At least not in this movie, it seems like the arena is open for him to do better elsewhere.<br /><br />So basically, Saki Asamiya is deported from New York City and taken back to Japan, where she's conscripted, La Femme Nikita style, into finding out what's up with this teenager suicide bomber website with a mysterious ticker. She integrates into school as only a moody teenager can, is given a yoyo to play with, and starts her investigation mostly by sneering and getting into petty arguments with classmates. Luckily, though, the classmates she despises the most are involved with the website in some random way or another, and she's able to basically use momentum to find the badguy at the end. Kinda. There are a lot of plot holes, and weird diversions involving Kira (Riki Takeuchi, the best performer in this movie and one of the best Japanese actors currently working), the policeman who recruited her. Kira also has another important relationship with Saki, which again could have been really well-done if taken more seriously but instead just came off as random and weird.<br /><br />Anyway, one thing somehow leads to another, a few bombs go off, and you'll eventually get your yoyo fighting awesomeness. Actually, even during the more terrible bits, this movie is quite entertaining. It just has an ill-gotten attempt at emotional seriousness that doesn't work out for it, or it's an actually emotionally serious film that can't stay serious what with the whole yoyo fighting thing, or something. It should have been one or the other but it failed at both.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB\",\n",

Carping about the slow pace or minimal dialogue is like complaining Scorsese's movies are too violent or the Marx Brothers too zany. <br /><br />Like the car the two friends drive, this is an exercise in stripping things down to their essentials in search of authenticity. Like a Ramones song or an Edward Hopper painting there is absolutely nothing here that doesn't need to be.<br /><br />Warren Oates' character on the other hand is a study in inauthenticity. After visiting the US in the 80's and 90's with its malls and fast food chains (and indeed looking at the kind of product Hollywood churns out these days) it's clear that his kind won the race in the end.<br /><br />I've seen this on TV and in art cinemas a couple of times and I'm glad to hear I can now get the DVD.

              " b'Rene Cradona Jr - the man whose dad brought us the exploitation movie Survive! - turns his attention to the \\'70s craze for shark movies with Tintorera. To call this movie a Jaws rip-off is rather misleading in some ways. The fact that a shark is running amok is almost completely ignored by the director, who spends more time concentrating on the nudity and the background scenery. Perhaps the budget was so low they couldn\\'t afford to include many shark attack sequences. So, in an effort to pull in audiences, Cardona simply hired as many good-looking actors as he could and bribed them to remove their clothing at every given opportunity.<br /><br />American tourist Steven (Hugo Stiglitz) arrives at a paradise-like Mexican resort aboard his luxury yacht, where he soon falls in love with British tourist Patricia (Fiona Lewis). After a fall-out with Steven, Patricia beds down with local playboy and part-time shark hunter Miguel (Andres Garcia). However, while out swimming in the sea one morning, Patricia is devoured by a tintorera (tiger shark). Steven and Miguel begrudgingly become friends and spend much of the summer hunting for sharks by day and hunting for women by night. They reel in British holiday-maker Gabriella (Susan George), a free-spirited fun-seeker who readily surrenders herself to a three-way sexual relationship with the two charmers. Tragedy soon strikes as the tintorera once more returns to feed in the waters and, after a night-time massacre during which a group of party-goers are killed by the deadly shark, Steven finally decides that the time has come to exterminate the killer fish.<br /><br />Virtually everyone on the cast list spends half their screen time naked. It\\'s hard to imagine what convinced \"real\" and \"serious\" actors like George, Lewis, Stiglitz, Jennifer Ashley and Priscilla Barnes to appear in this film. Their characters certainly present no interesting or challenging acting opportunities, and it seems unlikely that any of them could have seen much chance here to further their careers in a meaningful way. The story progresses almost randomly, with practically no sense of suspense, urgency or purpose. The love angle is not slightly credible (Steven and Miguel are just sleazy, promiscuous woman-users, and it\\'s totally unbelievable that every time they speak to a female she becomes putty in their hands). And the shark angle, as mentioned, is neglected for such long spells that it becomes virtually incidental to the plot. I\\'ve seen some damned bad movies in my time, but Tintorera is definitely one of the worst of the lot. I\\'ll grant that it has unintentional hilarity if you\\'re prepared to look for it, but on a serious film-making level - heck, even on an exploitation level - it is a truly, truly, truly awful film.<br /><br />Apparently there is a 126 minute version of Tintorera. I have no desire to see it. The 90 minute edition I forced myself to sit through was quite terrible enough, without prolonging my suffering for an additional half an hour.',\n",

However, when you consider that in 1913 \"full-length\" films were rare--and often only 20 to 30 minutes long!

              " b'It starts off just as it is expected to with all the clich\\xc3\\xa9s about India. Yes, there are cows on street but it is hard to believe one in a call-centre campus. In fact, it\\'s hard to believe a call-centre office in a rural hinterland with callers having heavy first-language influence. I believe only GOOD speakers of English are recruited by these firms and they don\\'t change their outsourcing plans overnight. Travellers who make an impression of India based on this film may be pleasantly surprised if they actually visit the cities of India.<br /><br />Anyway, what got this movie really working is an interesting storyline, interspersed with comments and questions about cultures on both side of the \\'divide\\'. I\\'m not sure but it seems like the director / writer was pointing at issues here with outsourcing as a backdrop: 1. That there are PEOPLE (humans) working in companies - this is often overlooked by bosses remotely controlling company operations. This is not limited to call-centres and may not be limited to India. Just as in the movie, several jobs may be put to risk at any time by a \"20 heads for the price of 1\" logic. Right now, we in India are facing the same issue with the rise of \"cheap\" workers in the Philippines, who may be doing a good job a few years down the line.<br /><br />2. Several other interactions and incidents in the movie seemed to say - there are humans involved. Sensitivity is required in handling human issues, for example, the spiritual undertone of the characters or the surprise at \"calf-branding\".<br /><br />3. Within a span of a few hours drive, the director has been able to show that there are different kinds of people in any populace - with respect to wealth, hygiene, behaviour, etc. This is commendable.<br /><br />4. Several questions raised about each other\\'s culture can also start healthy debates. This makes this movie even better than it started out to be.<br /><br />Lastly, in case you decide to visit India after watching this movie, plan your travel well and just like any other part of the world, stay alert. Not all Indians are friendly. Most in the tourist destinations are out to fleece tourists, either legally (high rates) or illegally (robbing, thievery).

However, this movie mistakenly suggests that drifting young people have no choice but to drift in life and always choose the wrong way, so no honesty here. This is the type of movie that would be financed by the Hungarian state these days, because you can sell it partly as artsy, partly as `a movie that explores the boundaries of human life and concerns deep social and moral issues'. Well, if the director's intention was to shock (`let us all face reality' and all), he definitely failed, unless he thinks that in the era of hardcore porn and Hollywood B-movies nudity and superfluous violence are shocking. Sorry, I simply do not feel sympathy, sorrow or pain for stupid characters (involved in a stupid narrative), especially if they are sketchy, shallow, or more like empty. The dialogues are crap - believe me, nobody talks like that, ever. This language was invented specifically for this film (not a new phenomenon in Hungary), so it cannot be honest in this sense either. With a little malice, I might add that the amateur acting was so artificial that it drove me crazy after twenty minutes. There was nothing in this film that grasped my attention image-, story-, character- or otherwise. This movie has nothing to it, nothing at all.

              " b'I really wanted to like this film for a couple of reasons 1. Annie Griifin did a fine job with the Book Club and 2. It\\'s British. Sadly neither reason proved strong enough for me to be able to overlook Festival\\'s many flaws. <br /><br />I can only guess that Griffin\\'s original aim was to write a movie where comedy and tragedy were so closely linked that it was difficult to see where one ended and the other began and what better backdrop that the Edinburgh Festival which every year attracts acts from all four corners of the world, who come to entertain and supposedly change their lives? Definitely a strong starting point for a funny, touching and thought provoking movie, unfortunately this ain\\'t it. <br /><br />For one thing we are asked to focus on far too many characters, assorted comics, bizarre actors and various hangers on who each have a story to tell but no time in which to tell it. As a result they never become anything other than one dimensional characters and unpleasant ones at that. Who is Faith, the actress behind the one woman show about Dorothy Wordsworth? Why has she chosen to do this? Why has she brought it to Edinburgh, what is she hoping to achieve? We never find out. Is Brother Mark a real priest. Why does Petra put up with Sean? Is she in love with his or just too apathetic to do anything else with her life? What\\'s with the Canadian trio whose show touches the audience but who are presented to us as buffoons. And what about the depressed mother who abandons her child in what is presented to us as some sort of happy and romantic love story. Ditto the Perrier Awards which seem to be tacked on as an afterthought or just an excuse to introduce a bunch of stereotypical arty journalists spewing line upon line of bitchy clich\\xc3\\xa9s. Lots of questions but no answers and as a result the film added up to little more than an unholy mess. <br /><br />And then the sex scenes. One commentator actually applauded these graphic and let\\'s be honest gratuitous scenes decalring them to be \"real\" Well maybe he has been fisted many times on the floor of a puppet shop by a bald punk, I would hazard a guess and say that many of us have not. Guess that means movies like \\'Deepthroat\\' should be regarded as social documentaries rather than porno junk. <br /><br />I could go on to talk about the nonsensical punch up at the end but what would be the point? Suffice it to say that if this is the way that the UK Film Council is spending it\\'s money then it\\'s no wonder British film industry is in such dire straits.',\n",

              " b'\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is about a young college student named Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan), who disappears one night while going out with some friends. She is found on the side of road weeks later, still alive, with her hand and leg viciously amputated by her captor. But when she awakens in the hospital, Aubrey claims to be somebody else... a woman named Dakota Moss, a rough-living stripper who says that she is being mistaken as Aubrey, and that the real Aubrey Fleming is still in mortal danger. Aubrey\\'s worried parents try and uncover the truth, while Dakota tries to convince others that she isn\\'t Aubrey... but is Aubrey really just pretending to be someone else? Is she suffering from a psychological problem triggered by her kidnapping and torture? Or could Dakota really perhaps be a real person? Watch and find out.<br /><br />After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I\\'m not a fan of Lohan particularly, but this film looked good. Unfortunately, it has its ups and downs, but overall I thought it was a pretty good horror/thriller. The plot is original in its essential form, but does contain some clich\\xc3\\xa9s here and there - all things considered though, this is an original premise that deals with certain scenarios not often seen in cinema (if at all). It\\'s a mystery film, and it did do a very solid job at keeping the viewer guessing. The expected twists and turns take place as well, and I thought for the most part the plot twists were fairly well thought-out. You don\\'t really know what to think or expect for the first hour or so, as the story is pieced together linking Aubrey and Dakota, and whether or not they are in fact one person. I did become a little confused at moments, and there were a few plot holes (which I expected considering the complex storyline), but overall I didn\\'t see anything that affected the course of the movie. Things pieced together fairly nicely before anything became too much of a problem, but there were some holes that needed filling.<br /><br />Another thing that succeeds in this movie is the cinematography, it was really beautifully shot. Color (mainly the color blue) plays a vast amount of significance in the story, and while it is there for a purpose, it almost seems too obvious because the color pops up continuously in practically every scene. Still, beautiful cinematography and some stylish editing get good points in my book, and this movie had both. Even in the sexual stripteases done by the Dakota character (where Lindsay\\'s body is the main focus), the color use and cinematography shine. Good soundtrack as well that plays along with the flow of the film quite well, and really adds to the movie\\'s energy. I was surprised at the amount of violence in this movie, but don\\'t dismiss it if you are thinking it\\'s something along the lines of a blatant torture flick, because this movie has a lot more to it than just that, unlike the recent trend of horror flicks that are nothing but one big gory torture show. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" manages to pack some suspense and tension that are vital to a good horror and/or thriller, and there were quite a few really scary scenes. Strangely enough, there is some unexpected humor to be found in the movie as well. One scene in particular was really quite funny, and while I\\'m not sure if it made the film less believable or was in it\\'s favor, I know it made me laugh a few times.<br /><br />As for the acting, I think a lot of people are slamming this movie unfairly because of it\\'s lead actress, Lindsay Lohan. Whatever the reason that some may despise her, I\\'ll put it like this - if it were another actress playing the lead, people wouldn\\'t be as harsh as they are. Honestly, I think Lindsay gave one of the best performances of her career (so far) in this movie. Her previous films mainly consist of pointless teeny-bopper trash, so I respect her for doing something with a little more depth, and while her acting and delivery is a bit flat on occasion, she carries this movie well. Julia Ormand and Neil McDonaugh play her concerned and confused parents, and both do a good job in their roles too. As for the big secret ending (which I won\\'t reveal here), I thought it was fitting. The showdown between Lindsay and the killer, while a bit contrived, was pretty scary, as was the villain. The explanation behind the Aubrey/Dakota mystery was really strange, and I wasn\\'t expecting it to turn out the way it did, but I think that\\'s a good thing. It may be a bit of a stretch for some because of the obscure subject (and the revelation seemed to kind of come out of nowhere), but I liked it for being different and not what I\\'d normally expect in a twist ending.<br /><br />Overall, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is a different but original horror/thriller. Cinematography was excellent, the storyline (while a little problematic at times) was original and very intriguing, there are some pretty creepy scenes, and the big plot twist was different from the norm. The acting wasn\\'t that bad either, don\\'t judge the movie by it\\'s lead actress - I\\'m not a big fan of her either, but I found her to be fairly solid here. Recommended to horror and thriller fans if you\\'re interested in a bit of a strange but nonetheless interesting movie. It\\'s got a few plot holes and problems, but as I see it, the good outweighed the bad, and I was happy with the two hours I spent at the theater. 7/10.',\n",

It's cold, sometimes slow and completely devoid of laughs, despite the presence of Walter Matthau, who managed to add at least some (black) comedy to even the bleakest films (FAIL SAFE, CHARLIE VARRICK). Nevertheless, Matthau is still fine and Bruce Dern is excellent as his unexpected partner. There's also a really fine performance buried in the film by Cathy Lee Crosby (as the distraught wife of Matthau's first partner).

Let me say, I was not disappointed with the movie. If you like well-made, well-directed thrillers, it is definitely worth checking out. The story was simple enough; Rex's girlfriend mysteriously disappears at a gas station they stopped at while on vacation. Cut ahead three years and you still have him searching for her. Due to his persistence, the man responsible finally decides to get involved.<br /><br />With very little violence and no gore, Spoorloos was able to leave the viewer in a truly depressing state. Some people might call it boring but I found the slow and steady pace to work in favor of the characters, as the acting was top notch. So was the direction of the scenes, which were set up quite nicely. It was interesting to see such attention paid to both the victim and criminal's point of view. You could really understand the desperation, confusion, and obsession that Rex felt with his loss. In turn, you see cold evil in a form that does exist in our world. While maybe not shocking to all viewers, the ending is terrifyingly tragic, made so by the realism and calmness throughout the film. Just ask yourself, how would you feel if that happened to you?<br /><br />If pushed for a criticism, I would say that some of the symbolism seemed a bit too heavy handed but other then that, this is an intelligent, deep thriller. I have not seen the American remake (oddly enough, both versions are from director George Sluizer) but I can all but guarantee that the original is what you want to go with first.

Photographed by A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's Jacques Haitkin through layers of murk designed to conceal a multitude of budgetary deficiencies, and 'distinguished' by flashy editing and gymnastic camera-work designed to conceal the lack of a comprehensible plot, Tony Randel's unconvincing future noir trades the visionary outlook of the original graphic novel for the same lumbering, humorless approach which typified this particular subgenre before US producers *finally* learned how to imitate their Asian counterparts. Though brutal in places, particularly during the final confrontation between Daniels and Mandylor, the film actually *downplays* the gory carnage of its source material, which will disappoint those expecting a more faithful adaptation. <br /><br />A popular figure in this kind of DTV potboiler, Daniels was clearly hired for his fighting skills rather than his acting, and he's upstaged throughout by many of his co-stars (including Chris Penn, Melvin Van Peebles and Malcolm McDowell). Thankfully, Randel makes a virtue of Daniels' handsome face and muscular torso, and there's an unmistakable whiff of homoerotic tension in the aggressive relationship between Daniels and his equally handsome nemesis.\",\n",

This is his latest attempt at reclaiming his title as a horror master. It is a remake of one of the most infamous exploitation movies of the 1970s, but you know that you have problems when you cannot improve upon such dubious material. It is a real snorefest, about a serial killer targeting the residents of an old apartment complex. It is a silly movie, which does not even qualify as a good/bad movie. The last third of the film is an improvement over the lethargic first two thirds, but the movie ends refusing to explain itself. Very embarrassing.',\n",

The play was so short as to defy the need for a star but the movie is seen as a chance to sell you Barbara Stanwyck. The idea for the play just didn't have 90 minutes in it.<br /><br />The play built tension by confining listeners along with the invalid protagonist in her bedroom, which rapidly became a cage. Unfortunately it was expanded every which way until the clean machinery of the play is convoluted beyond recognition with plot, plot, plot as far as the eye can see; and secondary characters of no importance whatsoever talking the life out of things. We cut away from the room dozens of times for equally meaningless developments. There's an nightclub floor show. There's a secret chalet on a beach introduced with a clam-digging scenario. There's a chemistry lab, car trips, intrigue, sub-plots\\xc2\\x85 Expanding the play just loused the whole thing up. None of it is of any quality.<br /><br />It's all pointless elaboration of the weakest variety; it has no effect on the outcome. Stanwyck is just plain wrong for the role.

The story was daring and original, considering the usual high-tech kitsch that usually air on broadcast TV (\"24\", \"CSI\" and the likes). This show felt different - in a way it felt real, like it had meat on its bones. It was more than just stories of people and the outlandish things that happen to them - it dealt with ideas and got one thinking. War Stories talked about the grittiest, truest and maybe noblest side of journalism: war correspondents. This was a show that seemed to chose story lines mirroring reality, even if that reality felt a bit uncomfortable to acknowledge. Finally, I thought, a series that tries to be more than pointless thrills and suspense. The series was even mentioned by Newsweek magazine for its originality and provocative subject. Unfortunately, by next week the show was cancelled. I guess, since the show was too daring and didn\\'t fit a regular \"format\", the sponsors threw their weight around, and instead of more episodes of War Stories we got more mind-numbing sitcoms, reality shows, and cheesy thrillers. God forbid we see something controversial that expresses a different point of view, or gets us thinking. Still, I am hoping the producers haven\\'t given up on this one yet...',\n",

There are also some moments that will make you jump and there are two neat twists at the end.<br /><br />The only bad things about this movie is some clumsy exposition (John Cusack tells his whole life story while photographing a corpse), some truly bad lines and a surprisingly lousy performance by Cusack. What's happened to him? He looks worn-out and haggard in this film.<br /><br />However, these are minor problems and the film is well worth seeing and keeps you guessing about what's going on till the last moment.

              " b'I saw this movie at a film festival when it first came out and, after skipping over it at the local library for the last nine months, finally borrowed it on loan to see what my younger roommate would think of it and to view it again myself, nearly a decade later. It certainly features game performance by the three male leads, but the real triangle here is that of the gay male hunk, the plus size, clueless fag hag and nebbish gay guy. <br /><br />Unfortunately, what a number of viewers apparently found funny in Mara Hobel\\'s character of Christina, I simply found mostly tiresome and repetitive. From her scene walking in to the divey apartment \"Fabulous\" to her scene walking in to roommate Marc\\'s bedroom after he first has sex to her nervous breakdown or crying during the \"grand gesture\" to the whole cluelessness of her New York existence - it just was about four feet too much over the top and ruined what little good there was in her character or her performance. What was her degree in? Basket Weaving? She took that special class for the championship NYU football team in Ballroom Dancing? In 1997, she graduated from college without knowing how to find a semi colon on a key board?<br /><br />But so as to not seem like I am aiming all my daggers at Ms. Hobel, the idea that the \"bad\" good would turn out to be (a) a liar; (b) a user; or (c) a hustler were not only predictable but telegraphed not just a mile away, but a drive through the state of Texas away. Likewise, that the nerdy nebbish (Woody Allen without the fixation on the adopted children of his mate) gay guy -- who, unfortunately for him, was ten years ahead of the gay geek hotness era we find ourselves in -- and in any event, hot gay geeks are not Broadway musical fans much less piano players, would be in love (in classic Hollywood romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s fashion) with the gay hunk best pal and, ultimately, the hunk would (for no reason at all, without any real basis, after turning him down because the neb was clearly not the hunk\\'s type, and after lusting in love with a guy who\\'s only real thing in common with the neb is that they both have a musical background? You might as well say that the hunk fell in love with them because they both breath air.<br /><br />This film does have some charms and again, with a different writer and director, some different casting choices, a tighter script (it went on too long, meaning some entire characters could have been cut out), might have made more of itself. You could cut the entire Cynthia story down to 5 minutes and not make her a roommate and make Marc\\'s apartment a studio and have a much tighter and probably more interesting movie in the process. Perhaps then you could spend a little more time in the relationship between Robert and Marc to justify why they end up together at the end, other than rom com conventions of the Hollywood 40s and 50s and bad Broadway musicals of every era, say they must.',\n",

Not scary at all (and I scare so easy! that's why I love terror movies). Forgettable.<br /><br />For instance (spoiler coming) at the very beginning of it, the psychological expert tells us about how, when a person sees her or his doppelganger, double, it's an omen of death.

The lost potential in this film is monumental - between gathering the hardware which provides an authentic backdrop (aircraft, uniforms & flight gear, restoring a former WWII base for filming, etc.) and selecting a capable cast, the entire effort was shot in the head when it came time for the script - not to mention some model sequences which, in spite of emerging technology, still just flat don\\'t \\'work.\\' The juvenile behavior of the crew, particularly IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MISSION, was abominable. For me, the only shining moment was the exchange between John Lithgow and David Strathairn over the letters from home, voiced over with the gun camera footage. Beyond that, the overall film was deplorable. And after that much expenditure of effort to be wasted, I wouldn\\'t look for any other producer to undertake a similar theme. Spielberg tackled the infantry (\"Saving Private Ryan\"), Eastwood has done justice to the Marine Corps (\"Flags of our Fathers\") - but you\\'ll have to contend with THIS monstrosity for an 8th Air Force tribute.<br /><br />Want the real story of the 8th Air Force?

Beautiful, haunting location shots, spot-on musical score and some clever camera-work. Undoubted nods to the likes of 'The Thing', 'Blair With Project' and 'The Shining' but the director still manages to plant enough plot devices (mysterious white box, weird noises and footprints, well-acted descent into madness) to promise a worthwhile outcome.<br /><br />Sadly, at this point they run out of ideas. In fact if I didn't know better, I'd almost have thought that they switched directors about two-thirds in. Particular gripes: 1) Rubbish CGI. You do NOT need a monster to make your movie scary. Especially when it's some sort of reject from Rocky & Bullwinkle.<br /><br />2) The whole final scene. Been watching Resident Evil have we? The very final shot screams that they's completely run out of money and couldn't afford to do the apocalyptic wide angle shot that was needed here.<br /><br />3) Poorly done switch in pace. About two thirds in we go from slow, deliberate menace to frantic, unexplained chaos. Handled well this might have worked. It didn't.<br /><br />Reading this back it sounds really negative and that's not the impression I want to give. This was a decent movie and I suppose my annoyance is that it wasn't as good as it easily could have been given a bit more care and thought.\",\n",

Be aware of this. <br /><br />I read a few opinions on this website before watching Survive Style 5 and they were mostly misleading. I am not bitter but this is simply what I think. The film had it's moments which were mostly good comedy and some romance(or maybe that's just me being attracted to beautiful women), but overall the film was drawn out, the story was too difficult to comprehend, and I can endure long silences with no action or movement, but only when there is a purpose, and in this film I saw no purpose and lost interest through the film a few times. <br /><br />There was a review here on IMDb that described the silent character's role as amazing, but I just did not feel his amazing performance. In comparison, I watched Musa The Warrior the following night where the leading role is a silent one and I was truly awe struck by his performance, which had just as little dialog and I know it's a completely different story and setting, but writing and acting and directing created the most mesmerizing silent performance I have ever witnessed, and it ranks highly among all other characters I have seen. Musa's character was an amazing performance and like someone on IMDb already mentioned about Korean films in relation to SS5, there are better quality films out there with better writing, acting, directing, and which come together to make quality films that have a lasting impression because they are so compelling. Musa was one of these films that is so absorbing that after two hours when the film had ended, it seemed like on an hour and a half. <br /><br />So watch and enjoy what films you will, opinions are for the individual and should be cautiously observed. I hope you enjoy the film and many more Korean films to come.\",\n",

This movie is sadly one large stereotype, and as most stereotypes is greatly off the mark.

Well...<br /><br />Language was my first problem. You can tell that just about every actor doesn't know how to speak English, and that his/her lines were fed to them. I'd guesstimate that no more than 30 minutes out of the nearly 2 hour long movie were action scenes, so this movie was very full of dialog and story....only I could understand maybe %20 of it. It's really bad, probably as bad when Quentin Tarantino speaks little bits of Japanese in this film to a native Japanese speaker. Except this wasn't a few lines, but the whole movie being broken English. In Sukiyaki Western, the Language gets in the way of the story telling(I had no idea what was happening a lot of the time), and the acting. I'd much rather have had Japanese dialog with English subtitles...or at least English subtitles anyway, which were not available to me.<br /><br />The language is really a minor issue for me, because the whole movie itself was pretty poor. The script was simple and bland. I think they dumbed down the dialog to make it easier on the actors, because it was something I could have written up in the time it took to watch the film. Also, there were many failed attempts at humor. The jokes failed because the actors could not deliver them naturally.<br /><br />There was no character development, I didn't care about ANY person in the whole movie. The hero, if you can call him that, is a completely unneeded character. Another thing, and I don't consider this a spoiler....every single character in the whole movie was a blubbering idiot...like a bad guy from a Saturday morning kids show.<br /><br />The action was minimal, and the finale didn't do anything for me at all. <br /><br />The costumes. Yeah a couple of the leaders looked cool, aka they looked like members of a J-Rock band. None of the clothing was authentic, and I don't think it was supposed to be, but I thought the red Old Navy neck sweater on one dude was too much. The white gangs' leader dude wouldn't take much work to look like a hot girl.<br /><br />To it's credit, there was some cool style and cinematography going on, and if the whole movie was like the first 5 minutes, minus Quentin because he's a bad actor, This movie would have been awesome. <br /><br />It should have been 90 minutes, tops. It should have been awesome stylized action with heads rolling and arterial spray, then the bad acting, script and story could be overlooked. Instead it was 2 hours with tons of bad jokes and a few unsatisfying shootouts. <br /><br />I wanted to like it, and i know a lot of you people spending $50 on a Japanese import DVD might feel obligated to....but this was just a poorly made movie.\",\n",

The movie is filled with violent bloodbaths mirroring that of a Steven Seagal fight scene. How this guy comes out on top is clearly some well executed choreography. It leaves the viewer in utter disbelief. It basically takes a turn for the worse and loses momentum like a lead balloon like the director gained a terrible drug addiction and just didn't care anymore. I almost feel like I've been violated.

John Wayne was a great actor, and not the hollow stereotype that he was often accused of being as his popularity waned. He might not have been one's ideal for delivering a comic line, but if anybody could force a line to have dry humor, it was he.<br /><br />The script is the first disaster. The mock-Shakespearean lingo is for Shakespeare, who never set any of his plays in Mongolia. Here it is ludicrous (Chaucer would be in tune with the time, but few people understand Chaucerian English)! The costumes fail to convince one. Add to this -- Genghiz Khan was no hero; he initiated the most horrific killing spree of the pre-modern world. It's a big mistake to lionize a killer.<br /><br />The great lore of this movie is that so many of the cast and crew died of cancer during some A-bomb tests near the location. That is sheer bad luck. Even without the calamity of cancer allegedly contributed to by nearby nukes, this would be a horrible movie, an embarrasment for all involved.\",\n",

In short, a terrible Sci Fi channel type movie.<br /><br />It has its points such as the future is dirty, like \"Blade Runner\" showed ..... of course, this is no \"Blade Runner\". The Captain looks, sort of feels like actor Robert Forster, the kind of person one might want to be around.<br /><br />But unfortunately, it rather ends up feeling like a bad \"Andromeda\" rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of \"Aliens\", the mystic is vampire Willow sexually intensified, and the new Captain might as well be like Jan-Michael Vincent running around on \"Danger Island\" in the \"Banana Splits\"; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; he\\'s got very little right to it. All of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the \\'Eureka Maru\\' as they are fighting a class of \\'people\\' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities.......just like the Nietzcheans in \"Andromeda\".<br /><br />It might have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it, but it doesn\\'t help the movie much.<br /><br />It\\'s ..... \"okay\". Okay in the way that one might watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials, they will probably change the channel.

Solid supporting turns by Claude Akins as a famous country singer/songwriter, Gene Evans as a gruff police lieutenant, Lucille Benson as a stern, but friendly whorehouse madam, and Grace Zabriskie as a wax museum worker are likewise delightful. Special guest appearances by country stars Roy Acuff, Ray Stevens and Barbara Mandrell as themselves further add to the goofy fun. A likably silly timewaster.',\n",
              " b'The title is the sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump. It\\'s a mix of laughter and sadness.<br /><br />First color film made by Akria Kurasowa has been something I\\'ve wanted to see for a long time. Weirdly it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three or four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material. I was holding out for the full version, waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, only to find out on the recent release by Criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version.<br /><br />Finally sitting down to see the film last night I\\'m of mixed emotions about the film. First and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed. You can see every other of Kurasowals remaining six films reflected in this movie, down to the painted sunsets. Its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock he would he happy with (of course there are failed projects as well). The film is a visual work of art.(Though be warned if you\\'re going to see this on your widescreen TV this was shot 1.33 so will appear in normal TV ratio.) The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people don\\'t quite come together. As separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they don\\'t hang as one. I don\\'t blame Kurasowa since one can\\'t always hit things out of the box, especially when some one like Robert Altman who specialized in multi-character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself.<br /><br />This isn\\'t to say that there aren\\'t reasons to see the film. As will all Kurasowa films there are always reasons to see his films, whether they work or not. The first trip of the \"trolley\" is one of the best things Kurasowa ever did and is worth the price of a rental. Its one of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is inspected and taken out. The father and son living in the car is touching (though ultimately very sad) and there are other bits and pieces that shine (like the cast which is across the board great) and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films or crime dramas.<br /><br />Its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers successes.<br /><br />Between 6 and 7 as a whole, much higher in pieces.',\n",
              " b\"THE WEEPING MEADOW ('Trilogia I: To Livadi pou dakryzei') is writer/director Theodoros Angelopoulos (with influences from Tonino Guerra plus assistance from Petros Markaris and Giorgio Silvagni) creating a personal vision of the 20th century. The incredibly gifted Greek poet of a filmmaker mirrored the life and death of his own mother whose time on earth spanned a century and elected to capture the 100 years of sadness in a trilogy of films: The Weeping Meadow is Part I and details the years 1919 through 1949. It is a masterwork.<br /><br />The film opens with what will be the trademark look of the movie - vistas of lonely people in a nearly monochromatic color space that uses water, both from rain and the collected results of rain. A group of refugees from Odessa have landed by a river in Thessaloniki where they must attempt to reconstruct their lives. Among them is a family - a wife and husband with their young son and a three-year-old orphan Eleni they have protected. The entire movie seems to be in slow motion, but that is just the studied, unhurried rhythm of Angelopoulos' direction. As time passes we find that Eleni at a very early age has just given birth to twin boys while she has been sent away for the family's appearances: the father is the young son of the family. The story progresses through the World Wars, the civil wars, the influence of Hitler and Mussolini, the natural disasters of floods and disease, the social disparities of class, the rise of unions, the fall of democracy - all mirrored in the family that is trying to make the chaos of living in Greece resemble some sort of order. The young man is a musician and once he and Eleni have reunited with their twin boys, he decides he will go to America, the land of Promise for poverty stricken refugees, to work and make enough money to bring Eleni and the twins to America. But in his absence the progressive civil unrest and poverty the three endure in his absence results in the ultimate dissolution of the family.<br /><br />The story is less important than the moods evoked. The cinematography by Andreas Sinanos is a long gallery of miraculously composed, beautiful images: the cort\\xc3\\xa8ge on the river, the flapping white sheets behind which we discover musicians, the constant vistas of the ocean and the river, the village and the battlegrounds burn themselves onto our visual fields and into memory. The gorgeous music that accompanies this symphonic work is by Eleni Karaindrou, mixing folksongs with wondrous symphonic moments. The cast is superb: they manage to create very specific people despite the fact that we rarely see them up close. But in the end this visual treasure is the extraordinary work of Theodoros Angelopoulos. If this is Part I of a Trilogy (at almost three hours running time), we can only imagine the power that will follow in the Parts II and III. Experiencing THE WEEPING MEADOW takes patience and a long uninterrupted period of time; the rewards are immeasurably fine. In Greek with English subtitles. Grady Harp\",\n",
              " b\"Chances are, if you are only casually aware of the world that you live in, your life imitates that of the Finzi-Continis, one of two families depicted in this film. <br /><br />The beginning of de Sica's film follows the state of affairs in Italy shortly after the Fascist government of Mussolini has declared the ordinary tennis clubs off limits for Italian Jews-just the beginning for the Government's separatist stance. The Jews in town react in various ways: Giorgio, who is in love with the daughter of the Finzi-Continis, is enraged; his father his philosophical; Giorgio's brother is upset only after being sent to France to study, and later, finding out to his horror about the German concentration camps. To the Finzi-Continis, though, it doesn't really matter. They're different from the other Jews because wealth and privilege have bred them into a family as proud as it is vulnerable. They hardly seem to know, or even care, about the fact that their rights are slowly being taken away. It seems that years of prestige and social status have put them above the laws of the land.<br /><br />The walled garden of the Finzi-Continis is a symbol for the false security that people retain, unaware that problems on the outside may force them into reality. The garden of the film seems to promise that nothing will change and that everything will remain the same. Interestingly, de Sica films the garden in a way that enforces this theme of false security. He never orients us visually with the rest of the city, so we can never tell how big or how small the garden is. Have you ever felt uneasy being somewhere not knowing the exact dimensions of your boundary? That's the feeling we get here with shots of the garden that seem to stretch on forever. <br /><br />The Garden of the Finzi-Continis is a great film for many reasons, one of which is how it forces us to take a proactive stance regarding the world that we live in. There's nothing wrong with feeling secure but it's important to try to take an objective stance with reference to the world that we live in. And you certainly don't want to be on the outside looking in to those who have realized it already.\",\n",
              " b\"This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.<br /><br />The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least. Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....NOTHING.<br /><br />By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it? This seems unlikely.\",\n",

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.<br /><br />Synopsis: The story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.<br /><br />Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we already seen the same characters (play by Mc Lovin\\xe2\\x80\\x99) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.<br /><br />Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. And the acting is so-so as expected when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re watching this type of movie. And the direction, what do one expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.<br /><br />Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes.<br /><br />Cons: Not funny, dreadful story, nudity and kids do not mix together.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/10 (Grade: F)',\n",
              " b'This could have been a rather entertaining film, but instead it ranks with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek, it could have been a very entertaining film, like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often.<br /><br />The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is.<br /><br />STORY: $$ (No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult film).<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won\\'t be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts, that many horror film watchers enjoy, is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film-making endeavor is. Kim Terry, as his wife, does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. The \"teenagers\" were all horrible actors - no exceptions. Man, this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /><br />NUDITY: $$ (Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl\\'s bedroom. Both male and female nudity here).',\n",

              " b'OK, so Mr. Agrama\\'s company (which is involved in some dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi) produced a horrendous mish-mash by a Mr. Carl Macek.<br /><br />What is this horrendous mish-mash I\\'m talking about? Well, Macek took three entirely unrelated Japanese sci-fi animated series (namely, Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONS of dialogue - believing firmly that the American audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - , edited the whole lot heavily for violent content, added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting Hell (Reba West\\'s singing was - and still is - unbearable and a total outrage, especially compared to Mrs. Mari Iijima)... And the result was an 85-episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes.<br /><br />Of course, the mecha were cool to look at (especially those in the \"Macross Saga\") and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good. But whatever was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek\\'s work or the \"voice talents\" he recruited. It was because of the toils and efforts of the (uncredited - why? would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to Robotech now wish we had never been exposed to Robotech. The originals are so much better, naturally, and make a lot more sense.<br /><br />Robotech, however, DID something worthwhile: it prompted legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of Japanese anime creators\\' intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalled-for reworkings that talentless people like Carl Macek produce.',\n",

The movie had an intelligent story, and though it's called Spectres, it was more about a mother struggling to make life with her teen daughter as close to normal as possible after a suicide attempt. The supernatural aspect is a fresh view (which is rare) on the subject of hauntings.

              " b'Robert Desiderio wrote a wonderful role for his wife, Judith Light, in \"Save Me,\" a 2007 film about a religious group, Genesis. At Genesis, the idea is to make gay men straight. One of the heads of Genesis, played by Light, blames her son\\'s suicide on the fact that he was gay, unable to face up to the fact that it was her rejection of him that helped him along. Her second husband (Steven Lang), not the boy\\'s father, is a little more lenient in his views, and this causes conflict. When it\\'s obvious that two of the men at Genesis (Jeremy Glazer and Chad Allen) are attracted to one another, she becomes increasingly more disturbed.<br /><br />This is a very good film about, as far as I\\'m concerned, a misguided attempt by fundamentalists to \"straighten out\" gay men on the premise that it\\'s in the Bible. There\\'s so much in the Bible that contradicts itself, but there\\'s one thing pretty obvious in the New Testament - judgment is to be left to a higher power. A religious group that condemns someone not of their belief system isn\\'t, in my opinion, Christian or religious.<br /><br />So much for that. The film beautifully demonstrates its own point of view - love and meaningful relationships are what matter, whether between the same or the opposite sex. Jeremy Glazer and Chad Allen give fine performances as two men who have found their way to clean lifestyles but still need to be who they are and seek love with another human being.<br /><br />The star, of course, is Light, who, deglamorized and with darker hair, bears NO resemblance to the elegant Mrs. Mead on \"Ugly Betty.\" What a performance - and she\\'s been giving great performances for 30 years. One hates her prejudice but realizes that it\\'s born out of her own denial at the same time. Her husband\\'s attempts to understand her, his loyalty to her, and his desire to help her, are very touching. But he doesn\\'t feel as she does.<br /><br />In \"Save Me,\" we\\'re shown that a place like Genesis has its good points - there\\'s nothing wrong with getting off of drugs and booze and contributing to the community - but it needs to stop there. You can be gay without drugs, booze, and indiscriminate sex. You can also, as so well shown in the film, be gay and religious at the same time. No matter what anyone says, God doesn\\'t discriminate.',\n",
              " b'I\\'m thinking that it\\'s extremely unfortunate, from the perspective of this film or of those who would like to enjoy this film, that Jacques Tourneur seems to have departed from the production rather early. Certainly the pace of the film is completely dead in the water and the direction is more the listless early style of Mario Bava, who was uncredited for his direction of this film. Bava excelled when he was able to put aside plot and character and just focus on atmosphere, but this film did not allow him to do that. Instead it features many dialog scenes and a rather dull political story that Bava is unable to make digestible. The action scenes are fairly good towards the end, and there are some nice shots with the classic Bava lighting. That\\'s about it.<br /><br />Steve Reeves is our hero, this time appearing (as he did 3 years early in his debut in Ed Wood\\'s \"Jailbait\") sans beard. He plays Phillipides, an Olympic champion caught up in the Greco-Persian war. He\\'s in love with blonde Andromeda (Myl\\xc3\\xa8ne Demongeot), whose father Creuso (Ivo Garrani) is part of an aristocratic plot to overthrow Athens\\' democracy and replace it with a Persian puppet government.<br /><br />The first half of the film is basically setting up the romance and the war, and then in the second half you mostly see Steve Reeves running for what seems like 15 minutes, and then a huge naval battle with some interesting underwater photography.<br /><br />Only a few of the shots in the film seem to bear any mark of Tourneur\\'s style, such as the one that shows the Persian King Darius (Daniele Vargas) framed against his legions of soldiers in extreme closeup to contrast with the background. My guess personally is that Bava directed most of this film. It is a dull film even compared to Bava\\'s Hercules films with Reeves.',\n",

I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.<br /><br />At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.<br /><br />This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\". Here\\'s how I would have written it:<br /><br />An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he\\'s not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they\\'re on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.<br /><br />But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He\\'s a rotten director inspite what of people think. He\\'s trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.',\n",

Like most video game turned movies, I would say the majority don't translate into a different medium really well. And that goes for this one too, painfully.<br /><br />There's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story, and the mysterious island on which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) come to move into. The villagers don't look all too friendly, and soon enough, sound advice is given about the siren on the island, to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing.<br /><br />Naturally and slowly, things start to go bump, and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants. But in truth, you will not bother with what's going on, as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more. What was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill-placed-out-of-the-norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity, until it's explained much later. It's one thing trying to come up and present something smart, but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered.<br /><br />Despite it clocking in under 90 minutes - I think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark - it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to. Things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of too little too late.<br /><br />What saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end. Again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience. It turned out rather satisfactorily, but leaves a bad aftertaste as you'll feel cheated somewhat. There are two ways a twist will make you feel - it either elevates the movie to a memorable level, or provides you with that hokey feeling. Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter.<br /><br />The saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be that explicit - it's still not worth the time, so better to avoid this.\",\n",
              " b\"When I read the synopsis and viewed the trailer for The Living and the Dying I thought it would be a really good movie. Now that I have seen it; it wasn't what I thought it would be. It's what actually transpires after the prison break, so you need an imagination. Right from the start there is enough profanity and blood for ten movies. There are quite a few derogatory statements made against the female gender too. It was just to much, possibly an over kill. I didn't totally trash it because I thought some of the acting was decent and seeing a real SWAT team was pretty cool for a no budget movie. Another reason I didn't give it a low score of 1 because of a short that is on the DVD which in turn was pretty good. I also took into account that the film maker appears to have made a genuine effort in comparison to some of the other no budget trash I have seen.\",\n",

              " b\"The talented cast act this excellent screen rendition of Eugene O'Neill's play (it's adapted from three of his one-act plays)about crew sailors aboard a freighter steamer called Glencairn carrying charge containing war-smuggling,TNT, explosives from US to England, at the beginning WWII. The crew talk and contend each other but also save each other from bombing and risks. At the ending terminates with epilogue saying :'Some men like Ole and the Driscolls come a and go and the others live and die and the Yanks and Smittys leave their memories- but for the others the long voyage never ends'.<br /><br />This dramatic film is a classic Ford displaying his usual themes as strong factor in many films, as emotionalism, partnership, friendship and unlovable camaraderie between the sailors. However looks over-melodramatic during the reading letters from Smittys.The sailors show a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and own home: Sweden,Ireland, England. Straightforward acting by John Wayne as a Swedish sailor named Ole , he was to star habitually for Ford after the director rose his career from B Western in Poverty Row productions, with his greatest hit, 'Stagecoach'. There's magnificent secondary cast playing the seamen, as Thomas Mitchell as a sympathetic sailor, Ian Hunter as the drunk and unbalanced Smittys, Barry Fitzgerald as the humorous cooker,Mildred Natwick as a swindler prostitute, Rafaela Ottiano as a tropical woman, Jack Pennick, a Ford's usual, among others. Descriptive, evocative black-and-white cinematography by Gregg Toland(Citizen Kane) plenty of lights and dark, reflecting loneliness, suspicion,frightening from crew and the smoky, greasy, sweaty atmosphere from merchant ship. The picture belongs period when John Ford(1895-1973) made a rich variety of stories and his reputation rightly rests on his work in the 1940s, as \\xc2\\xa8Grapes of wrath,How green was my valley,Fugitive,They were expendable, My darling Clementine\\xc2\\xa8and the Cavalry trilogy: \\xc2\\xa8Fort Apache, She wore a yellow ribbon, Rio Grande\\xc2\\xa8.

              " b'I loved Westworld, so I was excited to find out Futureworld was being aired on a local UPN station. I\\'d read reviews that Futureworld was disappointing, but sometimes futuristic \\'70s movies are a blast to watch regardless of their flaws. :-) Well, Futureworld was a real stinkeroo. I actually had fun laughing at many parts that weren\\'t meant to be funny. I could go on for days about the ridiculous plot holes and unanswered questions, but here are just a few of my favorites: <br /><br />Why did they lead us to believe that Clark, the faceless robot \"friend\" of Harry the mechanic, *could be* The Gunslinger? Clark seemed pretty harmless, but I was waiting for an exciting moment at the end of the movie when he revealed his true, merciless character (The Gunslinger)! Instead, Clark was more of a paperweight in his scenes.<br /><br />What the heck is with the dream sequence between The Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) and Blythe Danner\\'s character? That was so ridiculously bad that I had to turn away during parts of it. I understand it was a dream and dreams can be really weird, but that doesn\\'t mean filmmakers have to put all our bizarre dreams on film! Before I saw the dream sequence, I was hoping so much that Brynner\\'s cameo would add something to the movie. Instead, I was embarrassed for him. They could have cut the entire dream sequence and it never would have affected the film.<br /><br />Fonda\\'s and Danner\\'s characters started punching buttons on the white chamber and suddenly three ninjas materialize out of nothing! First of all, that occurred before we knew the Delos scientists were engineering human clones of the world leaders. So when I saw the ninjas magically appear fully clothed and with weapons, I was thinking, \"Since when do mechanical robots and their trappings materialize from nothing?\" Then, when we find out that these new insidious creations are flesh-and-blood, that still left me thinking, \"How on earth would you create a human clone from thin air?\" <br /><br />Why did Fonda\\'s and Danner\\'s characters agree to run to Westworld to hide? Did they think they could start a new life in the abandoned Westworld? We learned in the first movie that Westworld was surrounded by the Mojave desert, so there wasn\\'t an escape route in that world. If they hoped to escape Delos, Westworld was certainly not the way out.<br /><br />Oh yes, if Delos spent millions fixing up and expanding all the worlds, even adding more worlds, why did they leave Westworld untouched? That would still be a world that people would want to enjoy, and the tragedies at Delos weren\\'t any worse at Westworld than they were at the other worlds (in the original film). It seemed to be a strange oversight in the film.<br /><br />The big finale. I have to say I was a bit disappointed that the movie ended with Peter Fonda flipping off the evil and conniving Dr. Schneider, with Dr. Schneider responding with a melodramatic slamming of his hands on the railing of the platform he was standing on. Maybe it would be have been good for a laugh if Schneider had held his fists in the air and yelled, \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\" a la Darth Vader at the end of Episode 3. ;-) <br /><br />I do want to note that the computer-generated 3-D faces and hands were pretty advanced for 1976. I also enjoyed the \\'70s decor and architecture -- one of my favorite parts of \\'70s TV shows and movies. :-)',\n",
              " b'Dracula Vs. Frankenstein starts in \\'Oakmoor Cemetery\\' on a dark cold & stormy night as Count Dracula (Zandor Vorkov) digs the remains of the Frankenstein (John Bloom) creature up. The film then switches to a beach near an amusement park in Las Vegas. Jodie Fontaine (Maria Lease) is wandering around on her own when a big ugly guy called Groton (Lon Chaney Jr. as Lon Chaney) chops her head off with an axe. The film then switches to the Vegas strip where Jodies sister Judith Fontaine (the director\\'s wife Regina Carrol) is a headlining act, we see her performance for a few minutes as the film becomes a low rent MGM musical. Afterwards she discusses Jodie with Sargeant Martin (Jim Davis) from the missing persons bureau, Judith doesn\\'t receive much encouragement & decides to investigate Jodies disappearance herself. Meanwhile Jodies decapitated head has been reattached to her body by Dr. Duryea (J. Carrol Naish) who just happens to be the last living member of the Frankenstein family & now conducts his experiments from an amusement park attraction called \\'Dr. Duryea\\'s creature emporium\\' which exhibits various freaks. One night Count Dracula turns up & convinces Frankenstein to reanimate the monster. Judith teams up with a guy named Mike Howard (Anthony Eisley), a guy known as Strange (Greydon Clark) & his girlfriend Samantha (Anne Morrell) & they eventually stumble across the truth, which be honest I don\\'t really understand, & have to fight for their very lives against Count Dracula & his silly looking laser beam shooting ring, both Frankenstein\\'s monster & mad scientist, Groton, a dwarf named Grazbo (Angelo Rossitto) & a rapist biker named Rico (Russ Tamblyn), whew what a crazy film & I\\'ve barely touched the surface of what happens!<br /><br />Produced & directed by the infamous Al Adamson I loved this crazy, almost unbelievable film! You can\\'t really judge Dracula Vs. Frankenstein by standard film criteria, instead you just need to sit back & enjoy the ride because I personally think this film is great fun to watch. Dracula Vs. Frankenstein quite literary has everything, it has a Frankenstein monster that looks like a speeding train has hit it\\'s face head on, Count Dracula with a silly looking beard & an afro hairstyle, who talks with a bizarre echo throughout & has plastic teeth that bulge out of his mouth, a drug addicted mute hunchback assistant, a wheelchair bound Dr. Frankenstein with a gay looking goatee beard, ancient comets, lab equipment that would look dated during 20\\'s, we do indeed see (well almost as it\\'s filmed in the horrible day-for-night process) a Dracula Vs. Frankenstein fight at the end, a biker gang & a weird guy named Strange who gets excited about playing with an old tyre in an alleyway with his girlfriend! The script is all over the place, the dialogue is insane as Dracula says things like \"your fear will fully energise the molecular structure of your blood\", or a cop that says \"if you\\'ve got a fireplace burn some wood in it, it\\'ll be a lot better than running around on the streets\" to a bemused Judith, Mike & the hippies also provide plenty of choice dialogue & lets not forget Dr. Frankenstein\\'s mumbo jumbo \"we are not butchers... we are scientists\", almost every line is an absolute classic laugh-out-loud moment & I loved all of it! Dracula & Dr. Frankenstein only meet once in the film & generally speaking Dracula & Frankenstein\\'s monster are relegated to bit-part characters as the film focuses on Dr. Frankenstein\\'s experiments & Judith\\'s investigations, which is a shame. Also, the plot is hardly logical, it makes virtually no sense whatsoever as Dracula says Dr. Frankenstein\\'s serum will help him create an army of undead Vampires & some nonsense about the human body being reanimated with a natural substance made when someone is decapitated but what does that matter when a film is this consistently entertaining? The special optical effects are terrible, check out the laser beam from Dracula\\'s ring. I thought the make-up on the Frankenstein monster was OK & it looked quite freaky. There is some gore, a couple of ripped off arms, some neck biting & a few chopped off heads. There is also one brief shot of female nudity. Technically Dracula Vs. Frankenstein is a bit of a mess, there are some awful day-for-night shots, the performances have to be seen to be believed, the music gets on the nerves after a while, the props & sets are cheap & the photography is point & hope for the best stuff. But having said all this what it basically boils down to is that I found Dracula Vs. Frankenstein just so entertaining & loads of fun, & surely that\\'s what watching films is all about? Impossible to recommend as most sane people will hate every demented second of it, but I\\'m not most people am I? I\\'ll sign off by saying I loved this film, so bad it\\'s utterly brilliant!!!',\n",
              " b\"Oh, c'mon, everybody, where is the love? First of all, when you slide some title off the shelf that never made it to theatrical release with a cover that features Dennis Hopper staring out at you in all his squinty-eyed, slightly soulful I-Am-a-Raving-Lunatic intensity. . .brace yourself for the possibility that you may be making a terrible mistake.<br /><br />Since the plot and writing credits have been hashed out already, I wont go into them, except to say I haven't seen so many people frothing at the mouth over a movie since they announced Michael Keaton was playing BATMAN way back in 1989.<br /><br />Sure very little of it made any sense, but was it fun watching Dennis Hopper rip his own face off? Sure! There was a pretty woman for the men to look at, a hunky guy for the ladies to look at, a decent cast, sadistic prison guards, a crazed warden, bogus science, a corrupt politician, a real electric chair, an autopsy, brain maggots, falling brains. . .my gosh. Fun galore on an evening when you've got nothing better to do. Are these my standards for great movies? No, but I didn't rent this title to see a great movie, or even a good movie. But my idea of a totally irredeemable piece of crap is NAIL GUN MASSACRE. So I'll save my venom. Couple of stars for the rating, at least.\",\n",
              " b'I can\\'t lie that I laughed during this movie, but far from how much I expected. First of all, I\\'d like to establish that even though Rodney Dangerfield has top billing--he only appears in about 20 percent of the film. And he has most of the funny lines. I liked the scene where he came out with a bandage over his pinky finger and said: \"I told my wife I hurt my little pinky. She said, \\'It\\'s OK. We\\'re not having sex tonight.\\'\"<br /><br />Kevin McDonald is the real star, and gets frightfully annoying at times. He was funny on \"Kids in the Hall,\" but he overacts way way too much in this one. You just want to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart.<br /><br />I thought there was great comic opportunity for a film that spoofs Mafia flicks. But it\\'s totally wasted with such flat gags. For example when they were spoofing the famous scene in \"Goodfellas\" where Joe Pesci gives that \"Do you think I\\'m funny?\" speech. However, the chick they used in that movie is REALLY REALLY hot. But that\\'s no compensation. If she got naked...maybe.<br /><br />\"The Godson\" definitely has its moments. But they\\'re wedged between the most brainless, flat, annoying, sometimes disgusting gags. If those gags weren\\'t torcherous and simply devoid of laughs, I might regard this movie as OK. But those gags are so tedious and mind-numbing that they drown out the few laughs that do exist--so much that I have no choice but to regard it as awful.',\n",

They may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. The young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives, whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community.

              " b'Mel Brooks has brought out a couple of outrageously funny movies, and Leslie Nielson has starred in his own series, but this one measures up to neither standard, alas.<br /><br />One of the problems is that the original \"Dracula\" with Bela Lugosi was so perfect in its thingness that, after only a few viewings, it\\'s practically a self parody. In the 1930s version, Lugosi serves some drugged wine to Renfield. Renfield: \"Aren\\'t you having any?\" Dracula: \"I never drink -- wine.\" I doubt that the people involved in the production intended the line to be a joke, but that\\'s what it\\'s become. In Mel Brooks\\' version, the line is repeated and the camera holds on Leslie Nielson\\'s face, waiting for the laughs to die down.<br /><br />A second problem is that the gags vary from funny to silly, as is usual with Brooks, but there aren\\'t enough of either kind. We seem to follow the 1930s version fairly closely, almost as if it were to be taken seriously. And the jokes that pad out the scenes simply aren\\'t that amusing. In one conversation (in \"ancient Moldavian\") both Nielson and Brooks try to get the last word in. It drags on. And in the last scene of the movie, Brooks is alone with the coffin containing the now thoroughly cremated Nielson. He glances around, slyly opens the coffin an inch, and shouts in the last word of the ancient Moldavian conversation they\\'d had half an hour earlier, then slams the coffin shut and strides out with a look of satisfaction. If that\\'s the best that could be done for a climactic gag, well, there\\'s a problem.<br /><br />There are other problems. Brooks is okay in the part of Van Helsin, but Leslie Nielson is a bit old for the part of Dracula, and he doesn\\'t have the accent. (It ought to be overblown in a movie like this.) See George Hamilton do a better job with better lines in HIS Dracula parody, \"Love At First Bite\".<br /><br />It\\'s not a total waste and there are some funny moments. It\\'s just that there aren\\'t enough of them.',\n",

It's inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is, please don't make me describe it. Words can't express how completely awful this movie is. This isn't just bad as in being a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5,000, and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is. After giving Pokemon the Movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. It looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film. If you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund.

              " b\"This was one of my favorite TV comedy series' ever, ranking with Newhart and Carol Burnett. At the time I was disappointed that the series ended after so few episodes.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I found 'Ivan the Terrible' delightful for what it was: mocking Cold War-era satire, ridiculing an obscene communist political system, played entirely for laughs.<br /><br />Of course it, like Hogan's Heroes, it was not intended to accurately depict the realities of the time and place depicted, nor their spirit. Doubtless life in Moscow was bleak, just as life in a WWII POW camp was grim. <br /><br />It has been said that the most effective means to destroy an idea is to make it into a joke and lampoon the oh-so-serious pretensions of its adherents.<br /><br />Just as the Wendy's television commercials themed on a Soviet fashion show delightfully derided the USSR's uncultured clunkiness, so did Ivan the Terrible. (The Soviet Embassy reportedly protested the Wendy's television commercials, so their sting was not lost on the oh-so-serious folks in Moscow. It wouldn't be surprising to learn of similar USSR protests against Lou Jacobi's sitcom.) <br /><br />One thing nobody has alluded to and which does not appear in that late actor's credits on the internet, is the uncredited cameo appearance at the end of each episode of Harvey Korman as a stern uniformed Soviet bureaucrat.<br /><br />The echo of unseen Carlton the Doorman from MTM's contemporary Rhoda series in the 'person' of Rasputin the dog was a nice touch, too.<br /><br />Ivan the Terrible was for me the perfect Cold War comedy. Sadly it was about the only such, unless one counts the Boris and Natasha scenes in the various Rocky and Bullwinkle animations.<br /><br />I would love to obtain tapes of the few episodes made, almost as much for Korman's walk-ons as for the rest of the show in its own right.\",\n",

A group of five close friends are heading through the back roads of Texas on the way to their grandfather's vandalised grave. Among them are Sally Hardesty, and her brother Franklin. They encounter an hitchhiker (Neal) who slashes both himself & Franklin with a wicked-looking knife. The others manage to get the hitchhiker out from the vehicle, but shortly afterwards, they are forced to stop & wander over to a small, sinister looking house nearby in hopes for gas. What none of them realise is that this house is the home of Leatherface and his evil, demented family of cannibalistic psychopaths. One at a time, the teens are murdered by the evil Leatherface in horrifying ways. I thought that this was a great film in the end.\",\n",
              " b\"Having first seen the directors' 12min take on Poe's Fall of the House of Usher, I was looking forward to seeing this one too and wasn't disappointed at all. Though perhaps not quite up to the same level of artistic attainment as 'Usher' it is nevertheless very much in the same vein.<br /><br />Like the 'Usher', the viewer should be familiar beforehand with the story on which it is based. In 1928, the directors, Watson and Webber, could have safely assumed the audience's knowledge of the biblical tale. (Interestingly, apart from the actual Genesis account, a phrase from the Song of Songs is also used when Lot is offering his daughters to the mob outside, desperately trying to convince them of the attractions of 'woman'). To complain that the film does not present the plot more overtly is beside the point, and almost a declaration of ignorance.<br /><br />The basics of this tale (for those that know them) survive intact its retelling through the particularly distinctively visual, sometimes abstract or symbolic approach of Webber and Watson, and its protagonists are all clearly identifiable and well portrayed by the actors.<br /><br />On the whole, a more accessible film than the 'Usher' film from the same directors. It bears, even demands, repeated watching. My only wish is that Webber and Watson had made more than just these two films together.\",\n",
              " b\"Nostalgic look at one night/morning of a small California town and some of its teenagers. Story-wise this is nothing new--all the stereotypes are in place--the loving/bickering couple (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams); the rebel (Paul Le Mal) stuck with a 13 year old (Mackenzie Phuillips); the nerd (Charles Martin Smith) having a disastrous date with a blonde (Candy Clark); the hood (Bo Hopkins) showing the good boy (Richard Dreyfuss) a night out and Harrison Ford and Suzanne Somers in small parts. <br /><br />What makes this movie better than average is the great direction by George Lucas--he fills the Cinemascope screen masterfully; the non-stop soundtrack of 50s/60s hits; a great script and the cast of then-unknowns. It's incredible to see some of these actors so young (especially Ford and Dreyfuss) and full of life. Without this cast, this movie would probably have long-since been forgotten.<br /><br />So, no great shakes, but very sweet and nostalgic with some good acting. Worth catching. Try to see it letter-boxed or on a big screen.\",\n",
              " b'I thought I would give this a go, after spotting an advert for it in a well-known UK film magazine. I knew Hollow Man 2 was in production, and as a fan of the first movie I was a little non-plussed to find the sequel getting a Direct-to-DVD release.<br /><br />So I wasn\\'t really expecting much...<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find an engaging little movie - very much in the spirit of the first (no brain, no logic, full speed ahead with cardboard characters and a plot straight from the back of a 40-year-old comic). It has many faults - Christian Slater just ain\\'t up to the job any more (but seems to be enjoying himself), a long and overly-talky middle act, some extremely ropey visual effects (though it has to be said that there are many good ones despite the obviously low budget), a blatant re-use of a scene from the original Hollow Man not-very-well-disguised, and a conclusion that felt very rushed - dare I suggest the budget ran out?<br /><br />On the plus side however the 2-dimensional characters are engaging, there are one or two great jump-out-of-seat moments, tips of the hat to not only the original movie but also HG Wells\\' novel \"The Invisible Man\", effective use of music (which is all new - not a rehash of Goldsmiths original) and an overall sense of fun (That\\'s Executive Producer Paul Verhoeven shining through, I think) - despite the nasty moments!<br /><br />To the people that are slating this saying \"It\\'s not as good as the first, really disappointed\" etc etc, I simply have to wonder exactly what they were expecting! Shakespeare this ain\\'t...<br /><br />But to the people who are open-minded enough to give this an honest go, you will get out exactly what you put into it. It\\'s not Shakespeare, but it certainly is Hollow Man.<br /><br />If this is the future for the Hollow Man franchise (there is the obligatory - but well executed - set-up for a Hollow Man 3), it could be an awful, awful lot worse.<br /><br />Bring \\'em on!!',\n",

Possibly George Lucas might have been able to do a worse job directing this.<br /><br />Cinematography= B There are a number of sweet shots in this film.<br /><br />Costumes = A I want to own every outfit I saw Prince wearing this film!<br /><br />Script = F Dumb, dumb dumb. Wrecka Stow? I wouldn't have laughed at that when i was in grade school (and yes, I get it. Who could not get it?). I am just absolutely baffled by that scene. The rest is not much better. The script kills the film's ability to be funny, and its ability to draw you into the romance. <br /><br />Chemistry = B & F Prince and his sidekick have a chemistry that really works well. Given funny material, they could have really made some movie magic. A bad script pretty much sinks them, however. The chemistry between Prince and the women in the movie is nearly non-existent. The phone conversation scene was good, but that is just about it. Other than that, the romantic connection seemed awkward and forced. so B for Prince's chemistry with the male co-star, and an F for his chemistry with the 2 females.<br /><br />Acting = B Not bad acting really. All the main characters (except the older woman prince wants for her money at the beginning) do a good job. <br /><br />conclusion: Atrocious script and terrible directing sink this flick. Good acting, chemistry, and soundtrack cannot save it.\",\n",

While it may not be the funniest film he ever made, THE OLD FASHIONED WAY is perhaps Fields\\' most autobiographical work, as it recreates the life of the traveling player of the early 1900s, a life he experienced personally as a vaudeville juggler. (The exact year the story takes place is never specified, but the costumes and the reference to a \"new-fangled horseless carriage\" would put it around 1905 or so.) Fields\\' early years on the road were said to be pretty rough. He and his fellow performers were forever at the mercy of unscrupulous managers, forced to live in crummy lodgings where they ate poorly, in towns where they were generally regarded as no better than tramps and whores by the disapproving townsfolk. It was not unheard of for those unscrupulous managers to abscond with the box office receipts, stranding the actors in hostile territory without a penny. Yet somehow, with the advantage of hindsight, Fields was able to turn these unhappy memories into great comedy, comedy that also serves as something of a history lesson-- albeit a pleasant one --for viewers interested in the early days of the American stage.<br /><br />Because Fields was in his mid-50s when he made this film he was able to turn the tables, in a sense: instead of reprising his real-life role as a starving young actor he\\'d graduated by this time to the role of the unscrupulous manager, known here simply as The Great McGonigle. McGonigle leads a ragtag troupe of players who are touring the hinterland in that ever-popular temperance warhorse, \"The Drunkard.\" As our story begins this troupe is fleeing a town one step ahead of the sheriff, and heading for their next engagement in the village of Bellefontaine, where prospects don\\'t look much better. In desperate need of cash, McGonigle is compelled to woo a local wealthy widow who aspires to the stage, the magnificently named Cleopatra Pepperday (played with appropriate magnificence by Jan Duggan), while in the meantime his daughter is wooed by a college boy who also dreams of performing. The boarding house where the troupe stays serves as the locale for two hilarious comic set-pieces, back-to-back: first, McGonigle\\'s lunch is ruined by Mrs. Pepperday\\'s rowdy toddler Albert, who flings food in his face, grabs his nose, and dunks his pocket watch in molasses. And then, as if he hadn\\'t been punished enough already, McGonigle must listen to Mrs. Pepperday\\'s spirited rendition of \"The Sea Shell Song.\"<br /><br />These two sequences alone are reason enough to make this movie a must-see comedy classic, and, interestingly, in each of them Fields himself plays victimized straight man: first to Baby LeRoy, then to Jan Duggan, whose rendition of the song is a show-stopping triumph. Fields\\' reactions to both of these characters are priceless, but it\\'s also worth pointing out that in this instance the notoriously paranoid, cantankerous W.C. Fields, who was said to be deeply jealous of other comedians, generously shared the spotlight with not one but two fellow players and permitted each to temporarily steal the spotlight, to the ultimate benefit of the project.<br /><br />The movie\\'s finale consists of the troupe\\'s performance of \"The Drunkard\" plus a couple of songs and, best of all, The Great McGonigle\\'s juggling act. This extended sequence feels like an authentic recreation of just what an evening at a small-town theater of the period would have been like, from the cheap-looking sets and declamatory acting styles to the heavy curtain that hits the stage with a crash after each scene. The juggling bit is a special treat, as it represents the most complete filmed record of Fields\\' legendary feats of legerdemain. My only complaint is that there are too many cut-away shots showing audience members\\' reactions; I\\'d have been perfectly happy to watch the whole routine in a couple of uninterrupted takes with no reaction shots at all. But in any event, the juggling act is wonderful.<br /><br />According to a recent biography of W.C. Fields by James Curtis THE OLD FASHIONED WAY suffered through a troubled gestation process. Just as the film was going into production Fields\\' original screenplay, entitled \"Playing the Sticks,\" was found to be somewhat jumbled and too brief to sustain a feature-length movie. Apparently the savior of the project was an unheralded screenwriter named Jack Cunningham, then known primarily for his earlier work on Westerns such as THE COVERED WAGON and a couple of Douglas Fairbanks vehicles. It was Cunningham who reworked and expanded Fields\\' original script into the seamless story it became, and who chose to interpolate the sequences from \"The Drunkard\"; he also persuaded Fields to dust off his old juggling act for the finale. If this background information is correct then viewers owe a debt of thanks to Mr. Cunningham for his important contribution to this terrifically entertaining, funny, and nostalgic slice of theatrical Americana.',\n",

              " b\"Senator Leroy Clark ( Gary Merrill ) arrives at a top secret underground base known as 'Project Tic-Toc'. Here scientists have spent the past decade attempting to master time travel. Clark is there to see whether the billion dollar project should be shut down or not.<br /><br />After being shown around a fantastic complex by Dr.Doug Phillips ( Robert Colbert ), he meets General Haywood Kirk ( Whit Bissell ), who escorts him to the Time Tunnel - an awesome two-tone vortex that seems to stretch into infinity.<br /><br />Determined to prove the Tunnel works, Dr.Tony Newman ( James Darren ) makes an unauthorised trip, materialising on the deck of a passenger steamship bound for New York. It is not any old ship either; the date is 14 April 1912, and he is aboard R.M.S. Titanic...<br /><br />The opening episode of Irwin Allen's sci-fi series begin in much the same way as the feature film of 'Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea' with V.I.P.'s being shown around a Government-funded project. The scenes where Phillips shows Clark round 'Project Tic-Toc' impress even now, with sets that look designed for the cinema ( I was reminded of the Krel complex in 'Forbidden Planet' ) rather than television. Shots of guards running across a bridge would be reused in later episodes.<br /><br />Neither Doug nor Tony have given much thought to what to do with time travel once they have perfected it. Both recklessly attempt to change the course of history by warning Captain Malcolm Smith ( a bearded Michael Rennie ) of the impending maritime disaster. The consequences for the future are not given any consideration.<br /><br />British actress Susan Hampshire plays 'Althea Hall', making her first and only trip to New York as she is suffering from a brain tumour. Tony urges her to leave in the lifeboats as there is a doctor in America who might be able to cure her. This sets up a pattern for the rest of the series; Doug and Tony are powerless to prevent major disasters, but can and do save individual lives.<br /><br />As the two scientists wear the same clothes throughout the series, its fair to assume the Tunnel must contain some sort of deodorising element, otherwise the people they meet each week would be repelled at their lack of personal freshness! <br /><br />A strong opening episode. And no sign whatever of Kate Winslet and Leonardo Decaprio!\",\n",
              " b\"Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.\",\n",
              " b'This movie will really give you better understanding of such terms as \"purposeless\" and \"pointless\". It\\'s simply a series of episodes, which never add up to anything. The only thing one can recommend about this familiar drama (which still doesn\\'t make it worthwhile) is the solid acting: Barkin\\'s performance stands out.',\n",
              " b'It didn\\'t really look that way from the previews (looked more like a whodunit) but it is. It\\'s like SPEED or THE FUGITIVE in that way and like RUN LOLA RUN in it\\'s structure. So if you like those films I\\'d say it\\'s a safe bet for you. It also has a really great car chase scene and this is coming from someone who usually doesn\\'t \"get\" those. During that whole sequence all I could think was \\'how did they choreograph that?\\' because it had to be really precise. I mean the cars were almost dancing.<br /><br />You have a stellar ensemble cast here. Forest Whitaker plays a witness to the events who gets caught up in the whirlwind. I don\\'t think I\\'ve even seen him run before so this was a little different for him. Matthew Fox and Dennis Quaid play secret service men. I was surprised how little screen time Fox had and if there is a star it\\'s Dennis. I don\\'t think it appeared that way in the trailer either. But mainly the whole thing was split up between all these different characters and their vantage points on this assassination attempt on the US president in Spain. William Hurt plays the president and I\\'m thinking I\\'m going to write him in in November. He just looks the part. Sigourney Weaver plays a TV producer who is a witness as she\\'s producing the live coverage and for a minute I thought we didn\\'t see her vantage point but her\\'s was the first one we watched. We were watching along with her and I didn\\'t realize we were already doing the multiple point of views thing. They all culminate at about the same point and once we\\'ve seen all of them the action continues from there into a perfect ending.<br /><br />This film really gets going right away and there is no time for a potty break. There isn\\'t a lot of cursing, just a couple words here or there, and not too scary violence so people who watch \"LOST\" and \"24\" level action should be able to handle it. This is the sort of movie you used to only get in the summer.',\n",
              " b\"STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /><br />When a man is mysteriously murdered at a party, a couple of homicide detectives are assigned to investigate. When they go to interview a colleague of the deceased man, they come attack from a mysterious enemy and, when his partner is killed, the male detective is pulled into the mysterious world of invisibility experiments that the man's colleague was involved in and the dark motives behind the killing.<br /><br />Honestly, what did I expect with a straight to video sequel to 2000's Hollow Man? After Alone in the Dark, Christian Slater (who is barely on screen for half an hour) has become a name to definitely avoid. His wooden performance, along with a boring and unengaging storyline and laughable special effects, make this one a none-stop boreathon, even at under an hour and a half. *\",\n",

It was showing at the CMJ convention in New York back when it first came out, and that was quite possibly the films only stint in theaters. The acting is poor, the story is far worse, and we walked out when we\\'d reached our breaking point. Luckily since we had passes for the convention, it was free, but even then i felt ripped off. As for a plot summary, imagine a completely cliched, pandering, and trite attempt at \"anarchy\"; spearheaded by lots of cheesy intimations to \"the man\" and rampant overuse of the term \"fascists\". A complete crapfest.',\n",
              " b'And Mary Tyler Moore as the sociopath Sante Kimes. Her history is very interesting, and frightening at the same time. Moore gives an excellent performance here, she is not over the top and quite believable as Sante.<br /><br />Robert Foster delivers a good performance as Ken \\'Pappa\\' Kimes- Sante married this man for his money, enjoyed the high life in Los Angeles, Nevada, the Bahamas and Hawaii. Apparently Sante was capable of anything. She got her husband into a political affair for Jimmy Carter\\'s election (similar in personality to John Wayne Gacy, who worked volunteered for Rosalynn Carter, and Ted Bundy, who volunteered for the Republican Governor in the state of Washington).<br /><br />Basically Sante flips when her husband does not leave her any money in his will- he leaves it to his children. This kicks in her major criminal behavior, which leads her and her son (who is her devoted slave) to New York City. She manages to get her attractive son to rent an upscale apartment owned by wealthy NYC socialite Irene Silverman, (well- portrayed by Jean Stapleton). The scenes with Stapleton and her boxer, Sophie, are truly upsetting. Silverman was murdered on 4th of July weekend, when her house-man and maid were off for vacation. I believe there was also a scene where they drove from NYC to Manalapan, Florida (The wealthiest city, near Palm Beach ).<br /><br />In court, Sante stands up and screams to the judge ...\"there is no body...so there is no case...I am innocent\".... A truly frightening movie, as it is all true. Sante and Kenny were sentenced to 220 years in prison, and presently the state of California is attempting to extradite them for their crimes in California. Highly recommended.9/10',\n",
              " b\"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist. Then he's approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go. His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection- but they don't want him merely to capture their man- they want him taken out. All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls at Dial's feet. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him.<br /><br />This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere, with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time (I don't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere.) With this in mind and after Snipes's history of duff DVD efforts, this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it's hot. But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway. It doesn't rank among his worst, but it doesn't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all, really), either.<br /><br />This is, at best, mildly suspenseful, with a minimal of action, naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role. Likewise, in a main supporting role, it's quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their CVs.<br /><br />It says a lot that by the end the only 'contract' that's keeping you interested is when Snipes's will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films. **\",\n",
              " b\"I saw 'New York: I Love You' today and loved it! I was really looking forward to seeing this after watching 'Paris je t'aime' and overall I think I liked this one much better... Perhaps I need to watch 'Paris je t'aime' again I don't know... I read few of the reviews here about NY:ILY and yes, the movie is not without its faults. When you're paying tribute to a city like New York - it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice... so without elaborating on any of the film's shortcomings, I'll just write about what I liked.<br /><br />Unlike 'Paris je t'aime' in which each director's short film was properly segmented and titled, NY:ILY isn't and many reviewers over here have found the seamlessness of stories and overlapping of characters here annoying and even confusing. I thought otherwise. I loved how the stories just flowed one after the other and I especially liked the overlapping of characters - it might be gimmicky because it's done so often in films now. But I still liked it because I didn't find it forced. And the idea that we're all connected in the end has a wistful, even whimsical quality to it - which some might find corny but I find beautiful.<br /><br />I liked all the films but the one that touched me the most was the one by Yvan Attal with Robin Wright Penn and Chris Cooper. It was so well-acted and scripted that the reveal in the end - again not unused in the past - brought me to tears and I was crying throughout the segment that followed. I always liked Wright Penn and now I'm also a fan of Chris Cooper. Those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant, just before he gets the call - speak volumes about Cooper's ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything.<br /><br />Most of the stories in this film involve characters who are either meeting each for the first time or have met each other just recently with the exception of 4-5 stories in which the characters have known each other for a long time. It seemed to me (and I might be wrong) that the stories were different but they were all trying to drive home the point, the need even, to just step back and view in a new light the people and the things we've known in our lives for a long time; to see the people and the things around you with the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them just as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time.<br /><br />The other films that I liked were the ones by Shunji Iwai with Orlando Bloom and Christina Ricci, by Natalie Portman with Carlos Acosta and Taylor Geare, by Brett Ratner with Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirlby, by Shekhar Kapur with Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf and John Hurt and once again the one by Yvan Attal with Ethan Hawke and Emilie Ohana when they're in the caf\\xc3\\xa9. I really need to see more work by Yvan Attal as I seem to like him a lot! <br /><br />Overall, watch this movie with an open mind. Don't read the reviews before watching it! It might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in New York should be and I doubt any movie will really live up to that conception. Just watch this movie for some good music, beautiful landscape cinematography, some slice-of-life comfort and a story or two that might just tug at your heartstrings.\",\n",
              " b\"I really wish that the cars had hurried up and eaten Paris like 10 minutes in, so I wouldn't have to sit through this boring waste of time. The poor lighting and budget really show here and make this movie painful to watch. This movie is so devoid of any action and is so frustratingly paced that I barely made it through without fast forwarding. In fact I showed this movie to a friend with major parts fast forwarded and he didn't miss any of the plot. Watching this movie in fast forward (my 2nd viewing) shows just how many scenes were totally worthless and just add to the boredom. I have seen other Weir movies before, and understand that his pacing is really slow and doesn't follow conventional plots, but this movie was very unappealing. Picnic At Hanging Rock is a vastly superior Weir film if you are at all interested in the director. That movie creates an interesting mode and the mysterious circumstances are inticing, here there is no inticement. This movie is recommended only to those who are either Austrailian and have an interest in some black humor (which is greatly lost on anyone who isn't austrialian) or those who like to watch MST3k quality movies, minus the commentary.<br /><br />Zoopansick\",\n",
              " b'I first saw EMr.S as a teenager who had just come out of the closet. As a child I was a fan of \\'60s horror films (Carradine, Cushing, et.al.) and black comedies (e.g., \"No Way to Treat a Lady\") and suspense/murder (\"Eye of the Cat\" or \"Wylie\", \"What Happened to Aunt Alice?\", \"Daddy\\'s Gone a Hunting\", \"Who Killed Teddy Bear?\"). EMr.S, at least as I remember it after 20 years, combined those genres. The title character, handsome and bi-sexual, added the homo-eroticism that made for a very happy young gay movie fan indeed. It also led me to learn that the Brits were years ahead of Hollywood in the treatment of gay characters in movies, and I now count \"Who Killed Sister George?\" and \"The Leather Boys\" as other personal favorites.',\n",
              " b\"Maybe a bit naive to think but I thought that amateur movies like this weren't made anymore in this era- and most certainly didn't received a global release.<br /><br />The movie really surprised me how incredible amateur looking this movie was. Not only with its acting and visual style but also with its technical aspect, such as the editing, camera-positioning. Especially the editing is extremely lacking at times. It makes some sequences come across as disjointed and confusing. Also the weak camera-positioning most certainly doesn't help all of the sequences. At times the movie really looks and feels as if it was being made by a couple of high school students who decided to pick up a camera and start shooting an horror movie.<br /><br />The movie just isn't ever tense, scary or mysterious, were also lies a big problem of the movie obviously. For a genre movie it just does basically everything wrong to reach a good enough and effective end result.<br /><br />The musical score is also quite horrendous. It's a very simple typical kind of movie score, that is too prominently present at times when nothing is happening in the movie and not present at all- or not good enough at the tense or scary moments of the movie. The music has some huge misses in the movie, it could had truly enhanced some of the scare moments and tension of the movie at times.<br /><br />Of course the story also doesn't help much. The movie doesn't have the most incredible pace and story-flow. The movie also tries to be more clever than it really is, by putting in many plot twists and making things seem different than they truly are. Without doubt they also did this to make the movie original. The result however isn't much good, since it makes the movie unnecessarily difficult to follow, especially toward the end, when twists and false twists follow each other rapidly. Through the many twists the movie also starts to make less and less sense. The movie is filled with some gaping holes and the more you actually start thinking about the story, the less sense it starts to make. Not only are there many improbabilities but also many things that just plain good old fashioned plot holes, mistakes and other things that don't make much sense.<br /><br />Judging by looking at this movie Mr. Woelfel (is that even a real name?) watched a bit too many Japanese horror and John Carpenter movies. In its style it mostly tries to impersonate Japanses movies and in its story, storytelling and characters it mostly tries to impersonate John Carpenter horror movies. Nothing wrong with impersonate different styles and applying them to your own style film-making but the style just doesn't work out, mainly due to its poor budget, weak editing and story-flow. It's perhaps even a bit sad to see at times how hard they tried, without a good result.<br /><br />I had no idea who Jay Woelfel was before this but looking at his filmography he seems like a regular B-horror movie maker, who just isn't the most talented or visionary person around, no matter how hard he ever tries. He is one of those typical persons who thinks he can write, direct, produce, edit and compose all of his own movies. And does he think he is Brian De Palma, with using all those redundant and completely pointless split-screen shots that don't add anything at all? Yep, I think I'm going to watch more Woelfel movies alright.<br /><br />Yes, it's true that the movie is so bad at times that it becomes good. It's unintentionally funny at times, due to how clumsy it is made and how bad the acting and dialog are. Who ever told those persons in this movie that they could act in movies? Granted that the script with its many weak and often pointless dialog also doesn't help them much but honestly, it's obvious as well that the actors just don't have the talent for the job.<br /><br />On a positive note, the make-up effects are quite good looking. Same goes for the simplistic but effective special-effects.<br /><br />With the same story material but more money and real professionals involved this movie possibly could had been a perfectly good genre movie to watch. But not now.<br /><br />2/10\",\n",
              " b'First off, people need to stop ranking every Kim Ki Duk movie relative to others. It\\'s not like you see a Stanley Kubrick film, and then say it is OK but is not as good as Doctor Strangelove.<br /><br />This film delves into some of the basic themes he raises in his other movies, jealousy, male desire, etc...<br /><br />The basic plot is that an old man has raised a baby girl until she is about to sexually develop, so she is now a teenager. He has raised her on his boat. He takes people out on fishing trips, needless to say the guys out on the trips take a liking to her, finally a young man comes who she seems to fancy.<br /><br />The basic question is then whether the old man will be able to prevent her from falling in love with this young guy. The name \"The Bow\" comes from a bow he uses to ward off her potential suitors.<br /><br />Think of that scene in James Dean\\'s \"Rebel Without a Cause\" where the father of Dean\\'s love interest becomes angry when she still wants to have close physical affection with him, you can tell that buried beneath he has desires for his daughter, and hence he becomes easily angry and strikes out at her.<br /><br />So this is the basic psychoanalytical insight of attraction between father and daughter and the taboo at acts to prevent it from going any further.<br /><br />There is also the age aspect. This old man still desires, but it\\'s plainly obvious that the girl is much to young for him, and that he cannot compete with younger men. So there is a love triangle, affection between daughter and father, the weakness of age, and other foundational themes.<br /><br />This movie will be a appreciated by Kim Ki Duk fans, and anyone who approaches it with an open and non-judgmental mind.',\n",

I have seen other films. This one shows that she can play a desperate housewife who can be both strong and vulnerable to her husband played by Joe Mantegna. Jamie Lee Curtis is underused in this role. Fiorentino and Chloe Webb's characters form a believable friendship on screen that I wonder why Linda hasn't worked in five years is a mystery to me. Anyway, it's an all star cast featuring besides Webb, Mantegna, and Fiorentino but also Kevin Bacon, Ken Olin, John Malkovich, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The storyline needs some work. I loved the scene where Carla steals the guys' clothes while they are skinny dipping in a pool. The movie is about a reunion of friends who get together for a wedding that may or may not happen anyway. I plead that Linda gets work soon again because she is really one of the best actresses out there playing strong women rather than weak and superficial.\",\n",
              " b'My Take: Hilarious oddity piece with imaginative special effects and an appealing cast. <br /><br />What a weird way to make a movie! And yet, what a fun and enjoyable film it is. INNERSPACE is a highly enjoyable little film, with some fine nifty special effects and some hilarious performances by Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Martin Short. Not to mention Joe Dante\\'s wacky inventiveness in his direction makes INNERSPACE is fun film for a very fun-loving audience.<br /><br />Quaid plays Tuck Pendelton, a party animal of a scientist who volunteers to be shrunk to microscopic size and injected to the insides of a lab test rabbit. Things get awry when a rival company wrecks havoc in the lab, and one of his colleagues is forced to inject him to hypochondriac Jack Putter (Short) instead. While trying to find his way out of Putter\\'s body, Tuck changes Jack\\'s life, as he becomes his \"conscience\". On their trail is Victor Eugene Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy) and his group who wants this little science project for themselves. Then on is a combination of various chases, wackiness and secret services.<br /><br />The movie takes the plot of an old B-movie, and brings it back to life, turning it to a fun and highly-spirited sci-fi comedy. It\\'s like Richard Fleischer\\'s classic THE FANTASTIC VOYAGE, but it has its own unique ideas and storyline to set its differences. Dante keeps all in fast pace, and doesn\\'t keep us waiting for something to happen. The characters played by the leads are appealing and the script is filled with genuine laughs, with Short given the most. INNERSPACE is enjoyable entertainment, not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Rating: **** out of 5.',\n",
              " b'First of all, the title is kind of misleading: yes, there are blondes in this movie, but they use guns approximately 1% of the running time (at the most). Unless the title refers to their others \"assets\", in which case it makes more sense. Anyway, this spoof of \"Basic Instinct\" (with such side targets as \"Indecent Proposal\", \"Body Of Evidence\" and \"9 & 1/2 Weeks\") is certainly not lazy - there\\'s a visual or verbal gag every 10 seconds or so - but, unfortunately, only a small portion of these gags score; the first 10 minutes are the best, the last 10 minutes, in particular, degenerate into sloppy idiocy. For most of the people involved, this was their first and last film; one that I would have liked to see in more is former Miss California (or so the Troma DVD cover claims) Elizabeth Key, who is not only beautiful (though the nudity is provided by the other leading lady, Gloria Lusiak), but a pretty funny comedienne as well. *1/2 out of 4.',\n",

              " b\"When I saw LUST CAUTION yesterday I wasn't sure what to think. There were moments of transcendence and many others of what, at the time, seemed like tedium. I was frustrated that I couldn't decide if this was a masterpiece right away as I was with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, THE ICE STORM, and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON. When I woke up this morning I couldn't stop thinking about it. It has haunted me all day and I want to see it again. Perhaps my expectations were so high that I had trouble appreciating what I was watching. More than likely I was anticipating the already notorious sex scenes. In any case LUST CAUTION is another masterpiece by Ang Lee that may take time for some to appreciate it. Years to come it will be studied and watched compulsively. It will strike debate among cinephiles of its worth. Most importantly it will be a film to be treasured, perhaps not by many, but by a very enlightened few.<br /><br />During the sex scenes I was holding my breath. Lee's slow burn toward these instant classic scenes was like foreplay leading to an explosive climax. Lee's themes of repression and double lives continue in LUST CAUTION. I look forward to savoring and arguing about this film for years to comes.\",\n",
              " b'I am SURE there is some sort of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K made fun of. After seeing both this and \"Werewolf\" and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are, I became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here. Alot of people are saying that people who hate it \"are only scared by gore\", \"Don\\'t know good horror\" or stuff like that. Well, I don\\'t really care for gore, but I do want SOMETHING to happen in a movie! Most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around! Or walking around the house/garden! A movie requires something to give it atmosphoere, you don\\'t get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares. Oh, and \"Makes you think\"? Yeah, I was thinking \"MOVE! YOU @#$0&%!!\" One of the worst horror movie I have ever scene! <br /><br />P.s. For the record, I am a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, That kind of stuff.',\n",
              " b'Here\\'s the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly, it\\'s for two reasons. One, it concentrates of young people, VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and \"The Man in the Moon\" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens, it\\'s the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />The cast of \"The Man in the Moon\" is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she\\'s going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way.',\n",

But it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well.<br /><br />Tom Beringer wasn't too bad, I suppose, no worse than usual; but what possessed them to cast Billy Zane in this? Was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers? A way to made their film a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked.<br /><br />If they were actually aiming for success, then why not cast somebody who can act? Oh, and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct.<br /><br />As someone who sat through this mess, actually believing it would shortly redeem itself, I can assure you it never did.

Don't expect it to comply with general drama movie rules. <br /><br />*** BE AWARE OF SPOILERS BELOW ***<br /><br />After you ve seen 50% of it or so you think it's pretty common drama, quite predictable and possibly happily ending one.

But these thoughts faded away.<br /><br />The movie is not open-ended despite what some people say. You just have to think harder than you usually do while watching a regular movie. Be more attentive or watch it again.<br /><br />Capello makes you think. If you want to know what really happened analyze the details. There are answers.<br /><br />I give 9 out of 10, because Capello rudely and savagely ruined my hopes for the better ending :)\",\n",
              " b'Well, I\\'ve never seen a Huffy outrace a muscle car... but I guess when you are making a completely irrational film it is certain to happen somewhere along the line. I think you can count the lines of dialogue in the first thirty minutes on two hands. I guess the director\\'s rationale was that it\\'s better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid, than to open it and remove all doubt. Then again I think assuming there was any rationale involved in the production this movie is giving the director too much credit.<br /><br />This film has some of the most hilarious chase scenes I have ever seen. First you have Troy\\'s epic escape from machete wielding villains via his mountain bike. I swear this scene would not end. Literally ten minutes are spent tracking Troy as he eludes a car full of goons on his Huffy. Eventually the heroes give up chasing this kid in a car and decide to foot it. Sadly enough, they come closer to catching him on foot than they did when they chased him with their car. Finally, when it seems as though these villains are about to catch Troy, he hops into the back of a truck. This is no ordinary truck, however. This is a truck owned by the dumb, drunken protagonist Zap Rowsdower... yes, Zap Rowsdower. This guy is a cross between John Candy and Joe Dirt. I think that I could use my ass cheeks as a face and be a more effective actor than this guy. Anyway, after Zap and Troy reach a gas station another hilarious chase scene ensues. Of course Zap and Troy have the last laugh. The funniest part about this scene is when the villains car treads off of a hill and takes a long winded drive towards a creek. The scene could have easily been ended by just blowing up the car, or by the villains simply hitting the brakes but NO. For dramatic effect the director had the villains speed across a 500 feet straightaway into a creek.<br /><br />The chase scenes are all good and fun, but the supporting cast is what makes this movie so \"fun\" to watch. ESPECIALLY the character Mike Pipper. This character is a hybrid - one part Macho Man Randy Savage, one part Ted Kaczynski. I was just waiting for him to shout out \"Ooooh Yea!!!\" after every single line. And let us not forget the performance of \"Satoris\", the antagonist of the film. Satoris, as we learn, is hell- bent on taking over the world. He plans on achieving this by sacrificing our virginal protagonist, Troy. Unfortunately he doesn\\'t succeed. After a bunch of useless scenes, horrible acting, and utterly retarded dialogue the \"climax\" is reached when Troy kills Satoris and in doing so saves the world from the necessity to continue this horrible film.',\n",
              " b\"Embarrassingly, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that any father or brother can relate to... one brother is a bit 'wild,' the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly cast as the father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The movie closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format. Unlike most book to movie stories, this one measures up. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.\",\n",
              " b\"How can you not love a film where the invitations to the South African premiere were printed on barf bags? Especially when it has a pitch as insane as The Manitou, which sees Susan Strasberg growing the foetus of a 400-year-old reincarnated Native American medicine man in her neck and calling on Tony Curtis' psychic for help. Of course, Curtis being a phony he seeks help himself, first from Stella Stevens' gypsy and then, deciding to fight fire with fire, Michael Ansara's medicine man. Ansara gives a surprisingly good performance considering the material, but even his Indian magic isn't enough to fend off an evil Felix Silla from summoning the Devil himself, who can only be defeated by turning on every computer in the hospital at the same time and Susan Strasberg getting her tits out in a vaguely New Age Meets 2001 finale. Despite the synopsis, unintentional laughs are in short supply, although a sequence where one of Curtis' elderly customers is possessed, floats down the hallway and throws herself down the stairs is a mini-masterclass in ineptitude as it fluctuates between failed attempts at humour and laughable attempts at drama. Still, any film where the co-writer is blown up on screen and where a frozen nurse is accidentally decapitated isn't entirely without some merit.\",\n",

              " b\"This movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. What strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. Besides following the play like a TV broadcast, there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games. This brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory. Today's TV broadcasting style, so different than that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.<br /><br />The players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history. In this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In that regard, today's TV broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before.<br /><br />There are several highlighted players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague#o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil), and Sanchez (Mexico).<br /><br />This movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of Mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. Across all the movie, there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves. This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.<br /><br />Because of what happened because of referees during Mexico 1986, much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely Maradona-biased. Much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen, that they are as human as the players, and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other. Soccer rules do not allow referees to use TV based replays to make decisions, so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive. As a consequence, referees play an active part in the development of a game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie.<br /><br />The sequel movie for the 1990 World Cup, compared to this one, is just a source of bitter disappointment. Much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game, whereas this movie tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.\",\n",
              " b\"My favorite movie genre is the western, it's really the only movie genre that is of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them quite like Americans.<br /><br />Right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from Universal. Many such deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.<br /><br />Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures, noir type stuff with no real budgets. Just before Winchester 73 Mann had done a fine western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, that never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided Mann was the person he decided to partner with.<br /><br />In this film Mann also developed a mini stock company the way John Ford was legendary for. Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why I won't say, but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen. Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have.<br /><br />The hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film. After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns aren't carried in Earp's Dodge City. There's a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Dutch Henry Brown, played with menace by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there. Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialog.<br /><br />Another character Stewart runs into in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film. This may have been Duryea's finest moment on screen. He's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns. <br /><br />Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters who's fianc\\xc3\\xa9 is goaded into a showdown by Duryea and killed. Her best scenes are with Duryea who's taken a fancy to her. She plays for time until she can safely get away from him. Guess who she ultimately winds up with?<br /><br />There are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there ain't a sour note in the cast. John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, best known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief, but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times.<br /><br />Mann and Stewart did eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to do a sixth western, Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann walked off the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.\",\n",
              " b'In this film each unhappy family is, to a greater or lesser extent, the architect of its own demise.Many people have criticised the film for not saying much, or for being overloaded with story lines; for not following through or following through too explicitly. All in all it clearly confuses and divides people. I think there is a problem and it is not the movie that has the problem but the audience.This story touches on some of the last taboos in cinema namely the actual visualisation of homosexual sex, and even worse in the eyes of the beholders it addresses incest. The cross cultures/cross races thing seems to me to be a side issue to the main problem illustrated here which is that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way to quote Tolstoy (apt here as Shawn the black homosexual is reading \"Anna Karenina\" at one point in the action, and like Anna unable to come to terms with himself and the world in which he lives, eventually commits suicide.)The film comes originally from a stage play set in Glasgow. Some of the dialogue has been lifted straight from the play and so can sound a little stilted, but in my opinion this device helps to maintain the necessary distance between the action and the audience. This plainly is an allegorical piece, each actor fulfils a function rather than a character but the story is none the worse for that; many art house movies do likewise. It is the subject matter here that is so difficult. As for the actual movie, it looks good, in fact is amazing considering it was shot in 20 days in New York masquerading as Chicago (I assume to keep the costs down). The acting by the whole ensemble is excellent. And I think one has to give Anthony LaPaglia especial praise as the Architect in question clearly in the grip of an incestuous passion. This cannot be an easy kind of role for any actor to play, but, as one has come to expect of Mr LaPaglia, he carries it off to perfection which may go a long way to explain the uncomfortableness felt by some moviegoers. Within his oeuvre this film seems almost like a companion piece to the more hopeful \"Winter Solstice\". My advice to anyone wishing to see \"The Architect\" would be to go along with an open mind, expect to be challenged and perhaps you\\'ll come away with the same feelings as me, that this is a good film, a thought-provoking film but not one to watch just for the pure fun of it, go and see Mr LaPaglia\\'s other current film \"Happy Feet\" if you want that!',\n",

Will this ruse work?<br /><br />This delivers all the thrills and cutthroat pirate action anyone could ever hope for and even more. It has all the elements one looks for and wants from today's big blockbusters: impressive stunts mostly performed by Fairbanks himself, sword fights, pirate treachery, explosions, daring underwater scenes, a damsel in distress, the works. There's a few plot holes and questionable plot twists here and there but it all holds up incredibly well after all these years although in today's world lead actress Billie Dove would have been given more to do. That's a minor nitpick at best. If you like pirate yarns, check this out. Believe me, they just don't get much better than this.\",\n",

Instead of just making the Americans out to be bad guys, the Japanese people in the children's village either through greed (their aunt) or through indifference (Gardener, Doctor), also play their part in the children's starvation and death. So it's not just about war, or anti-war, though I can't think a better movie to watch about war.<br /><br />The animation is perfect also. Absolutely beautiful colors.<br /><br />As another testament to the power of this movie, I decided to sponser a child through Compassion after watching it for the second time, 8 years later.<br /><br />Everyone should see this one, but be warned, it's not Akira or even a Miyazaki movie.

              " b'Takva - A Man\\'s Fear of God is one of those films that playfully enact conflicts of fundamental importance for the world we live in. Takva starts off with humble Muharrem, an introverted single man living in Istanbul, being drawn into the inner circle of a Muslim brotherhood he has adhered to ever since his childhood days. When the erudite and strikingly pragmatic leader, Sheikh Cemal, appoints him as his financial organizer, Muharrem gets endowed with all the amenities and trappings of a modern world businessman. He has to collect rent and administer the order\\'s finances. His naive will to live a life according to what he thinks is the will of God clashes not only with his unfulfilled sexual desires, but also with the mechanisms of power within the order. The brothers\\' lifestyle may be conservative, but they run an organization that is fully intertwined with the present day social, political and economic life of Turkey. <br /><br />For Muharrem, who hardly understands any of this business, this means that every step he intends to make for the greater glory of God draws him ever deeper into the quagmire of corruption, lies and hypocrisy. The authority he is endowed with now makes him haughty and difficult to deal with, while his accumulated frustration increasingly throws him into literal fits. Everything escalates when he comes face to face with the woman he desires... <br /><br />The plot for this great film is based on an old folk tale from Turkey about a man who refuses to marry the daughter of his spiritual master although he clearly loves her. In Onder Cakar and Omer Kiziltan\\'s adaptation, the narrative serves to expose the inner mechanisms of puritan Muslim orders and throw light on the mental set-up of its loyal members. The film is pure fun to watch due to countless instances of great irony, a remarkable love for detail and breathtaking scenes of ecstatic rituals. While the filmmakers were very careful not to ridicule the milieu they\\'re depicting, their critical approach accounts for a film that substantially helps understand the way political Islam \"works\".',\n",

In less capable hands, that world could have been flat and lifeless on screen. Not so here. The every day life of friends is shown as raucous, witty, poignant, and as painful as we know real life to be.<br /><br />The cast embraced the characters, obviously having a good time bringing them to life. You like these people and root for them until the end of the film. Clea DuVall has the pivotal scene in the movie, and is flawless as she takes you through Jen's search for love despite her insecurity. Jensen Ackles' performance makes sure you'll never look at tampon commercials the same way ever again. And special kudos to Alice Krige, who doesn't have a lot of screen time, but her Zo is memorable.<br /><br />I've read some criticisms about the sex in the film; it's definitely in-your-face stark, but I don't think it was out of line for the storyline of the characters involved.<br /><br />The soundtrack was dead-on, complimenting the timing of the story with just the right mood and expanding the aura of the characters as they cruise through the film.<br /><br />Bottom line - I laughed, I cried. Then I laughed again, while I was crying. Any film that can take me through that in 98 minutes gets my over-35 vote of confidence.\",\n",

The other \"Mrs. Brown\" is his greyhound dog.<br /><br />By far, the best part of the film is Herman\\'s \"There\\'s a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\" night dream; it\\'s a great song, and was a huge international hit for the group in early 1967. Title song \"Mrs. Brown You\\'ve Got a Lovely Daughter\" is also a winner; however, it is not given a full performance in this film - and, it\\'s an even older track. Strong new material from the group (and session players Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones) might have helped this film. The \"My Old Man\\'s A Dustman\" scene/song is amusing, but why wasn\\'t a Hermits-sung performance if this song used? That might have provided the group with a film-supporting novelty hit; at least in the USA, which the Hermits seemed more able to do than Most...<br /><br />* it is spelled N-o-o-n-e, but the correct spelling doesn\\'t work. <br /><br />*** Mrs. Brown, You\\'ve Got a Lovely Daughter (8/3/68) Saul Swimmer ~ Peter N-o-o-n-e*, Keith Hopwood, Karl Green',\n",
              " b\"8 Simple Rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where Paul died which was the first episode I have ever watched of the show that comes on ABC. The Hennessy clan -- mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) -- look to one another for guidance and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter), the family patriarch. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a hand. I am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put David Spade in this show since he was done with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all and all this show is pretty good. This show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80's and 90's that used to be on ABC.\",\n",

Gallagher\\'s character says that while he experiences this \"fantasy\", he is happy, happier than he is in the real world. John Cage tells Ally that you can\\'t find happiness in the real world, and that is why she is only happy in her imaginary world. Hmmmmmmmm....

Watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster\\'s costume, the fact that the \\'hero\\' looks a lot like Keith Chegwin and such classic lines as the following: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: \"At last we meet Kor...\" Kor: \"Thrilling, isn\\'t it?\"<br /><br />Amazing!!I also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other such \\'interesting and engaging\\' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film, none of them actually happen. No, I\\'m not joking...there really isn\\'t a raging sea or a ferocious bird, it\\'s just trying to make you interested...classic in my opinion. This film gets 10 for pure entertainment value!!',\n",

I could actually write a 1000 lines about this movie but I won't. How about some adjectives.....brilliant, breathtaking, stunning, moving, tender, brutal, harsh, real, beautiful, heartbreaking, uplifting...just a few off the top of my head.

              " b\"I've seen and admired his later movies, including Hana Bi and Dolls, but i wasn't quite sure what to expect when i got the DVD version of this. As you expect with Takeshi Kitano, its both mesmerizing and infuriating, always teetering on a tightrope with brilliance on one side and hopeless pretentiousness on the other.<br /><br />Its so difficult to penetrate a movie like this - it is slow, but carefully paced, with a peculiar editing pattern. Scenes are held for a few seconds more than most directors would hold, catching characters staring blankly at the aftermath of an action. Events occur with little or no warning or apparent reason. Characters are mostly blanks - either husks of men, or just empty psychopaths, its hard to say. The climax is shown obliquely, from a distance, we can only infer what is happening later.<br /><br />So, to put it mildly, this is not your average gangster movie. In some ways, it has suffered with the passage of time - we are now spoiled with such complex portrayals of gangsters such as in the Sopranos, we find it hard to accept Kitano's almost noble portrayal of what are in reality brutal, selfish sociopaths. Perhaps its the Japanese concept of people being pulled along by the tides of life, rather than actors in our own destinies that is the real theme of this and his other movies. But is this the excuse for the hero being a callous killer? We find ourselves sympathizing with his increasingly rotten soul, rather than empathizing with his victims.<br /><br />Love him or hate him, Kitano is one of the most interesting film makers in the world today, and Sonatine is one of his best - just expect to be scratching your head in puzzlement at the end.\",\n",

There's everything from modern reading of Christian religion (Dogma did this much better and even that flick sucked) to lesbian love (Bound, anyone?), but still it is missing its own point of view and especially any coherence. I can very well imagine how this movie gets five stars in women's magazines and trendy periodicals.<br /><br />So, if goofy shallowness turns you on, this is your movie, but if you have any respect for yourself and movies with actual content, there are a whole better films to see.\",\n",

So the boys offer to work at the club. They even throw out a troublemaker to show their good intentions. However, the rich kids don't want them around.

              " b'I have a pet peeve and before I begin I want to say a few words about it. I have done a huge number of reviews and am constantly noticing that even the most mediocre films get scores of 10 from some reviewers. While this is definitely a better than average film, no sane person could say it deserves a score akin to that of GONE WITH THE WIND or THE GODFATHER. I think it\\'s great to love a film, but over-scoring it doesn\\'t lend much credence to your review. Just my two cents worth and I\\'m sure I\\'ll catch heck for saying it.<br /><br />As for this movie, it\\'s a nice little family film that benefits from being very unique and having several wonderful performances. In this slice of pioneer life film, William Holden and his son are left alone after the death of his wife. Needing a mother for the boy and someone to help out around their frontier homestead, he travels to the nearby fort to find a wife. There, he buys an indentured servant (Loretta Young) and brings her back home after marrying her. Not exactly a romance, I know! Unfortunately, there never really is any romance, as Holden and son treat her more like a hired hand and after a while it\\'s obvious she resents this--especially after she works herself to the bone caring for them. Into this very unhappy situation comes \"the stranger\" (Robert Mitchum)--who immediately realizes the problem and proposes to take Rachel away from this drudgery--and pay Holden for her! While there is a lot more to the film, this certainly made for an unusual flick.<br /><br />The performances all around are excellent and the film ended on a very good and not especially sappy note. Well worth your time and I have no serious complaints--other than the writer who indicated that Miss Young was playing a lady who was 25 (yeah, right!!). In actuality she was a decade older and she wasn\\'t fooling anyone--but still a lovely woman regardless of the age difference.',\n",
              " b'I really thought this movie was great. I took my grandparents to it as it was released to the cinemas. I am not sure if it has been released publicly or just because it was filmed where I presently live. It cracks me up that with all the phenomenal scenery - it was attributed to Arizona. (It was actually filmed in Southern Utah(Hurricane) - I went to the school they attended - its been torn down since) I was fascinated by the fact I had never HEARD of this movie.It was outstanding. Action packed - thrilling - touching - and yet realistic. It was awesome to see the reaction of children in the theater as well - they seem to feel along with the boys! THis was perfect for all ages - young to old - and impressive from start to finish. This may have been one of the best movies I have seen all year!',\n",
              " b'I see where some people did not much care for this movie. That\\'s the way it is with comedies. Not everyone has the same sense of humor.<br /><br />I liked it.<br /><br />I found Martin\\'s character to be very entertaining. His constant stream of BS is very entertaining. I know it\\'s comedy, so I am not like those people who felt a more traditional gangster actor would have been better. It\\'s his very silly over the top style which I found endearing.<br /><br />Moranis is OK. He\\'s too typecast for me, always playing a similar role. I thought he was maybe funnier in ghost busters. I don\\'t know. He\\'s a decent actor. It\\'s that whole square role he plays that gets to me a bit. He\\'s supposed to be boring, obviously. But he\\'s maybe too boring.<br /><br />I found the female cop love interest for Martin to be great. She\\'s cute and she\\'s funny.<br /><br />Joan Cusack...I have liked her better in other roles. She\\'s hilarious in Grosse Pointe Blank. She\\'s OK in this role.<br /><br />I liked the silent film style \"captions, or whatever you would call them a lot. They added humor to the movie.<br /><br />In summary, I found the movie very light, very entertaining, and cute. I like that type of movie. If you want something that requires no thought, where your goal as a viewer is just to relax and be amused, this is perfect.',\n",
              " b'Although I use the words Real World, this movie is more realistically a fantasy of what real love is often dreamed about. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as I watched it late night on cable. And Although I had seen it before a few other times , I really never paid much attention to it. I just knew that every other time I had it on, that somehow I was forced to stay tuned. And it finally paid off. The acting of the principals was superb. Chenoa Maxwell is a fox. Christopher Cherot is a multitalented up and coming young Black Filmmaker. And although I had to tone down the sound because I didn\\'t want the neighbors to hear all the profanity, in spite of this, I thought they did an excellent job. It was warming to see this movie where two people finally admit to themselves that they were hopelessly in Love with each other. It ended up just the way real people \"dream\" of. Unfortunately in the real World it seldom happens that way. Shucks...I felt like falling in love with Hav myself.',\n",
              " b'I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it, even though we had heard from a mutual friend how \"great it was\".<br /><br />Now, I am pretty conservative in my views, but I knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it. I figured before the movie started Michael Douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses, and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist. But I thought thats where the political statement would begin and end.<br /><br />OK, the plot was solid: Single president falls for a lobbyist. OK, this has potential I thought to be pretty entertaining, since the plot was unique. But then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial. The movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the President and Sydney(Annette Bening).<br /><br />There were several ridiculous premises in this movie: 1) The character Sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a \"closer\". Could she have been more flighty? She was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything. Hardly a \"closer\". I am an sales, and she could not \"close\" selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst.<br /><br />2) Secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible.<br /><br />3) The speech at the end was simply ludicrous. The line about \"I am a proud card carrying member of the ACLU\" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit something like that, being an active member of an ultra fringe group. Second, why even bring something like that up. You just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative.<br /><br />I thought the plot was great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the movie went from being a \"movie\" to a left wing political statement, which is why the movie failed.<br /><br />Its a shame to see a great plot ruined by Hollywood having to force their political views on the audience',\n",
              " b'This was better than an empty dessert. By that I mean, I went into this thinking it would just be an average, silly, exploitive film with gratuitous nudity and not much of an original plot. I got the nudity and a lot more substance. Yes this theme has been done before but there were many surprising twists and shocks that usually are taboo in films like this. This was a psychological thriller for sure . There was the clich\\xc3\\xa9. The usual suspect, the well to do pillar of the community , and of course negative traits of hookers and strippers. The usual fare ,setting the plate , for an all familiar film. The tension was there, check. The twists were there, check. Fine acting, check. The ingredients were there and then some. The movie, I felt, did a fine job of establishing most of the characters and showing their true selves ... Negative and positive. The realness was there. I will not give away the ending, only to say you will not be disappointed. Enjoy .',\n",

              " b\"Adam Sandler is rapidly becoming my favourite on-screen comedian. He has this knack of doing incredibly stupid films that nevertheless manage to put a big stupid grin on my face for the whole show. This one has all the Sandler trademarks: a daft plot, a pervading sense of (mostly) innocent fun, incredibly funny supporting cast, plenty of cameos, cartoon-like laws of physics, references to his other films (or is that vice-versa in this case?). His characters tend to start out unlikeable (such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison), but the viewer ends up rooting for them anyway as the film progresses and the character's good side is revealed. There is usually a positive, inclusive feeling to the comedy style: just about all the characters in the film (even the sleaze-bags) are treated well by Sandler's character (once he gets over his temper tantrums in this case), which puts these films head and shoulders above the derisive, divisive style of humour that seems so common elsewhere these days. Sandler's characters tend to only make headway when they are being good, which isn't a bad message for the kids in the audience. Yet there's nothing saccharine or Disney-esquire here. While some gags are a bit predictable, there are still plenty of surprises and some outright lunacy that keep it fresh. Even once you suds out what the Sandler formula is, the films are still enjoyable to watch. Sheer fun!\",\n",

Its totally up to date with any metal music out there now if not better. If they did decide to put out a soundtrack they would make back all their money they lost making this film. Also that house they filmed it in, i\\'ve seen it before and it was my dream house, but now i\\'d be too scared to step into it so i guess the movie was somewhat effective. Anyways, the music is awesome and its a crime against humanity not to of made a soundtrack. I\\'m gonna buy the stupid film on DVD just because I heard there was a music video on it. Damn, they got me.',\n",
              " b'Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short movies, i.e. music videos, are simply the best. I do not care if I get a sane sci-fi feature from this man, but I do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing, shriek yells, cool crowd choreography, and some bits of CGI and animation. There also should be a few uninterrupted videos. Everything I\\'ve mentioned is here. Stupid plot and over-the-top \"vanity fair\" are not a problem when I witness Mr Michael Jackson in action. To me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not \"king of pop\" which sounds moronic, especially for us, Russians, because \"pop\" sounds like the Russian word for \"arses\" and MJ is definitely not \"king of arses\"). I can re-watch his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and I never get tired of them.<br /><br />My first impression of this film was \"What is this...?\" (bits of different videos, some drawn images, unsettling jumps from one theme to another, absence of any cohesive plot line, some kids fooling around, etc.) but as I watched it till the end, I could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on TV nowadays. What I like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily.<br /><br />Without Mr Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality. He knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles.<br /><br />When I see a proper DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. \"HIStory I\", \"HIStory II\", and \"Moonwalker\" are all great, though only \"Moonwalker\" is more like one movie (with a solid \"Smooth Criminal\" theme, \"paparazzi\" topic, and a few weird spoofs and twists).<br /><br />Being no fan of MJ I can still give this \"film... like no other\" a solid 9 out of 10 (I\\'ve been hit by \"Smooth Criminal\" for sure and my major complains are the following: initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main \"MJ anti-drug campaign\" should have been given more \"sky-rocketing insanity and stress\" and there should have been more \"moonwalking\" itself of course). Thanks for attention.',\n",
              " b'Considering that I love sci-fi and horror films from the 1950s, it is very surprising that I rate this film as low as I do. It just happens that of a string of these type movies had by Universal, this is about the dullest one.<br /><br />I group of scientists are exploring when they stumble upon a huge crack that leads to underground caverns. When they descend into them, they are captured by the subterranean people. Because they have lived under ground since ancient times and are look much like albinos, as it turns out their civilization was swallowed into the earth along with them.<br /><br />At first, everything seems just peachy, but later these underground people turn out to be major jerks who keep incredibly ugly creatures as slaves. They beat the poor mole-like things and when the scientist complain, the ancient dudes attack. However, the above ground people assist the mole people to fight back against their evil overlords and they return back to the surface.<br /><br />Aside from a less than inspiring script with few things to scare you, the acting and direction are pretty dull as well. It is amazing that a film called MOLE PEOPLE could be as static and uninteresting as this one was.',\n",

Other movies that come to mind are the recent precious and the ribald Monster's Ball. They pretend to loath the ugliness of the reality they present but in actual fact revel in it. This movie is just such an example of worthy bourgeois film making passing itself off as insightful and profound. If anyone care to watch a film by sensitive film makers involved in telling real stories about real people with real problems, without the unnecessary dressage of actresses and their inflated personalities, check out anything by the wonderful Ken Loach (British) or the Dardenne brothers (Belgian).\",\n",

Our friend Orville is back too. He's trying to help the scantily clad girls, but they just keep killing him.

It is also somewhat boring too, as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such. The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that. The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course Summers attack scene too. What else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through. In the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants.',\n",

It's a perfect album, it starts out with Let's Go Crazy(appropriate for the beginning as it's a great party song and very up-tempo), Take Me With U(a fun pop song...), The Beautiful Ones(a cheerful ballad, probably the closest thing to R&B on this whole album), Computer Blue(a somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki(one of the funniest songs ever, it very vaguely makes fun of Appolonia), When Doves Cry(the climax to this masterpiece), I Would Die 4 U, Baby I'm A Star, and, of course, Purple Rain(a true classic, a very appropriate ending for this classic album) The movie and the album are both very good. I highly recommend them!\",\n",
              " b'I\\'ve always enjoyed non-linear storytelling. A number of people seem to have picked up on this aspect of the movie and thus dubbed it similar to Pulp Fiction (though no one mentions Reservoir Dogs) when this movie takes non-linear storytelling to a level beyond where Quentin Tarrantino was ever able to go.<br /><br />Now, certainly Memento came along afterwards and transformed the entire art of non-linear storytelling. However, Memento uses it to keep the movie watcher guessing until the very end, whereas Boondock Saints puts the pieces on the table, letting you try to put them together, but then will continue handing you pieces until the picture becomes clearer.<br /><br />Clearly the movie is designed to be over-the-top, both from Williem Dafoe\\'s character to the action sequences themselves. Williem Dafoe makes this movie for me. The plot, which centers on religiously-inspired vigilante justice, has an air of being somewhat cliched, although I would be hard pressed to name another movie which handles it in this matter.<br /><br />I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning, when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear. I thought the ending, in which various people are interviewed about their opinion of the \"Saints\" and how for some vigilante justice was an incredibly sensitive issue, made this point very clear.',\n",

(\\xc2\\x85And yes I know that was an entire sentence, but bare with me people; this is a long-winded review for a short pointless film).<br /><br />Filmed in \"somewhere\" Canada, with almost no budget, the plot to this freak show is trite, the police in it obviously never heard of \"State Jurisdiction\" because they end up chasing both Miya (Hookers) and Trent (idiotic, Anal Retentive, Generic, insecure College Student) all across the U.S. (and I thought only the FBI could do that). The camera is shaky, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like \"Ishtar\" and \"Leonard Part 6\".<br /><br />As far as the Skin scenes go (which is the only reason to even rent this movie, don\\'t even think of buying it) there are two of them. The first one is the only one worth watching though which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____(insert unknown actor here, he\\'s obviously done nothing else worth noting) in a seedy, disgusting Motel room (the kind with the busted sink that drips, and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it). It\\'s all S&M (riding crops, handcuffs, hot wax, and underwear licking) folks and in the end, he gets left in a motel room, with no money and cops waiting at his door (that\\'s goes to show you guys, don\\'t let a hooker tie you up in a \"middle-of-nowhere\" motel room). Sadly though, Kari shows no skin worth remembering, and that alone can cause deep-seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so that is definitely a downer towards this flick.<br /><br />As for the ending, *Snicker*Snicker* I know you probably wouldn\\'t mind if I revealed it to you but I won\\'t, you should spend your hard earned money for that one.

Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion. I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????\",\n",

Because of the extensive flashbacks in the beginning of the movie, in which footage from the first film is used, those who have seen the original recently will probably hate this; for the rest of us the flashbacks are almost a bonus: essentially you get to see two movies for the price of one.

              " b'By 1932, the California Tiffany studios had been hard-hit by the depression\\'s increasing damper on the motion picture industry, and had most recently been taken over by the troika of Burt Kelly, Sam Bischoff and William Saal, producing under the achronym K.B.S.<br /><br />One of the talented individuals attracted to K.B.S. during this turbulent period was Robert Florey, who had directed THE COCOANUTS, in which the Marx Brothers made their film debut, and co-authored the script of FRANKENSTEIN, then adapting and directing MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.<br /><br />A STUDY IN SCARLET was Florey\\'s third project at Tiffany, and he was again scheduled to both write and direct--his preferred mode of working. While producer Bischoff had purchased the motion picture rights to the title of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s novel for only a small sum, Florey was told to compose a new scenario to co-star Anna May Wong opposite Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />A cause for the alteration of the original plot is that producers may have felt the title exceeded the worth of the actual story. Conan Doyle\\'s original, written in 1887, was a vehicle for a denunciation of the contemporary Mormon practice of polygamy, which for American movie makers may have aroused concerns of censorship and regional distribution difficulties--just the type of difficulty a small, independent company like K.B.S. could not afford to risk. As well, half the narrative consisted of a lengthy confession, with Holmes only present in the prelude, which would have surely disappointed most filmgoers. While A Study in Scarlet was the first Holmes mystery Conan Doyle wrote, it had been filmed only twice before, with an English feature and an American short both appearing in 1914. Not until 1968 was the subject tackled again, this time by the BBC in a fifty-minute television presentation.<br /><br />Given a week to come up with a narrative to fit the picture\\'s title and Wong\\'s presence, Florey collaborated with his friend Reginald Owen, who had been chosen to portray Holmes, and split the $1,000 script payment. They collaborated on the continuity in consultation with Art Director Ralph DeLacy in order to utilize as many standing sets as possible, economies always being especially important at a studio like Tiffany, even on as significant a project as A STUDY IN SCARLET.<br /><br />At this point Florey left, having received the offer of a long-term contract from Warner Bros. on condition that he leave immediately to direct their comedic mystery GIRL MISSING. Bischoff allowed Florey to leave, with both agreeing that his replacement as director on A STUDY IN SCARLET should be Edwin L. Marin. Marin, age 33, previously had helmed only one movie on his own, a low budget item entitled THE DEATH KISS (1932). At K.B.S. he had just finished assisting Florey on THE MAN CALLED BACK and THOSE WE LOVE, \"waiting for such a break.\"<br /><br />Although the Florey-Owen script contained no similarities to the novel, their plot did demonstrate a familiarity with the world Conan Doyle created for Sherlock Holmes. Elements are present from other Holmes stories, especially The Sign of Four, \"The Red-Headed League\" and \"The Five Orange Pips.\" There are many of the typical clues, devices, and mannerisms.<br /><br />The title is incorporated to refer to a very exclusive organization called \"the Scarlet Ring,\" a group of eccentric and highly ambiguous characters so suspicious of one another that they are afraid to even walk together. Upon the death of any member, his property is divided among the remaining survivors; suddenly they begin to die at an alarming pace under strange circumstances. This group of individuals were personified by an unusual group of actors, including J.M. Kerrigan, Halliwell Hobbes, Wyndham Standing, Tetsu Komai, and Cecil Reynolds.<br /><br />Some critics have pointed out the movie\\'s similarity to And Then There Were None / Ten Little Indians, with suspects killed one by one and their murder announced by a nursery rhyme. But if anything, the influence was the other way around, since Agatha Christie\\'s novel was not published until 1939.<br /><br />The script of A STUDY IN SCARLET was extremely polished and well-constructed, developing at just the right pace while carefully building the appropriate mood and environment. The movie breathes life into the classically eerie atmosphere of the British mystery, creating a pervasive feeling of fear in the fog-bound studio streets of the Limehouse section of London. Strange gatherings, arranged by secret codes, take place in abandoned, out-of-the-way buildings; dark and oppressive dead-end streets are places of isolation and terror; fog and shadows hide murderers and their victims.<br /><br />Suspense is heightened by a number of devices. For instance, the killer is kept unseen, while at the same time menace is suggested by having the crimes viewed through the murderer\\'s eyes using a subjective camera. The silhouette of a giant shadow appears on a wall as the victim stares at the audience and screams \"It can\\'t be you,\" followed by a close-up of a hand checking off the name of one more member of the Scarlet Ring who has been killed. The climax of this technique comes in a long-take with the still-unknown murderer visiting the crooked lawyer played by Alan Dinehart: the camera completely adopts the viewpoint of the killer as Dinehart opens the door and the unknown individual is offered a cigarette, puffs of smoke ascending in front of the lens.<br /><br />The sense of locale was enhanced by the use of a nearly all-British cast, something unusual for a Hollywood-made Sherlock Holmes picture. Reginald Owen in particular was given the necessary latitude to offer a different interpretation of the Holmes personality. Owen portrays a much more human, less remote man, more akin to the personification offered by William Gillette in his stage play, to whom Owen even bore a certain physical resemblance.<br /><br />By the time A STUDY IN SCARLET was released, in mid-1933, K.B.S. and World-Wide had folded, with Fox handling the distribution. The picture opened to an excellent critical reception.',\n",
              " b\"'Standing Still' begins so slowly it took us nearly half an hour to decide that the movie was possibly intended as a comedy rather than a very long cigarette ad. There are also a few chunks of angst thrown in, and one painfully melodramatic reminiscence scene which might have worked if we cared more about the characters. The music is too loud, and the 'twist' at the ending was obvious about five minutes in.<br /><br />On the plus side, the women are easy on the eye, most of the performances are pretty good, and there are some genuinely funny moments in the last half of the film. It's not half bad... but it's not all the way up to half good, either.\",\n",
              " b\"The trouble with this film is it is very much of its time. It's hardly a film of the book, more an excuse to steal a few sparse ideas and try to string them together into a light-hearted comedy.<br /><br />There's really far too much slapstick, and 1950's style girl-chasing, no real sense of a journey as there is in the book.<br /><br />I wonder if anyone will ever make a proper adaption of the book, making proper use of JKJ's wonderful anecdotes? It would be tricky to do - they are often about completely different people from the three in the boat, but they are what make the book so good, and they've simply been discarded in the film.<br /><br />So, in summary, if you've never read the book, you're in for a nice surprise: comedy that is still funny after a hundred years and more, but don't let this film put you off.\",\n",
              " b'I think that if one has a personal understanding of the history of the circumstances which tie Andalucia and North Africa together, along with some of the cultural, social, and spiritual connections that are maintained between these two separate but connected worlds, the movie Vengo will strike you as being very symbolic.<br /><br />There is a lot which is implied and will go right over your head if you are not aware of the culture and history of this region (as well as being aware of the life and struggles of Gatlif as a Gypsy man born in Algeria, caught between these two worlds). Gatlif does not spell anything out for you. He leaves it up to you to try to put the pieces together, and he knows that there are certain types of people, with a certain awareness, who will be attracted to his films.<br /><br />I thought Vengo was incredibly deep with so much true emotion and so much of the subtle and misunderstood inner-struggles of the people of Andalucia being depicted through a number of overlapping stories and characters: The retarded nephew, the man whose daughter had died, the feuding Gypsy families, the exiled father of the son living in Morrocco, etc.<br /><br />This movie told the tale of a people and their will to hold on to the purest (\"Flamenco Puro!\") sources of happiness and joy within their lives, amidst circumstances which seemed destined to tear them a part and undermine their unity.<br /><br />An incredibly beautiful story with lots of information, emotion, and spirit.

              " b'There has been way to much chatter about how beautiful this film is with its sumptuous sets, costumes, and magnificent photography. On the surface this looks like another gangster film, this time taking place in Shanghai. But of course, it isn\\'t. The gangster scenario is just the backdrop really. <br /><br /> Shuisheng, a boy of 14, has come to the city to serve the haughty and beautiful Xiao Jingbao, the nightclub singing moll of Tang, head of the most powerful gang in Shanghai. <br /><br /> Shuisheng\\'s uncle is a riot as he gives the boy a whacky set of instructions on how to be a proper servant to snobby Xiao, wonderfully played by Gong Li. \"Call her \\'Miss\\'. Follow her wherever she goes, not to far behind, and not to close. That\\'s the rule. Hold her coat in your left hand and her hat in the right, but don\\'t let the coat drag on the floor. That\\'s the rule. Got it?\" And the Shuisheng replies, \"Got it.\" However, after \"Miss\" delights in calling him a country bumpkin, and chews him out a couple of times, (And why not, Shuisheng can\\'t tell a red dress from a green one.) the kid starts looking for the exit. When his uncle tells him, \"When she rings for you, stop everything (yes, everything) and go to her. Got it?\" His reply this time is, \"I want to leave.\" Bad move, uncle is most displeased. <br /><br /> In many ways, Shuisheng is the most inscrutable character in the movie. He\\'s got a real poker face, and you\\'ll probably have a tough time deciding if he\\'s an idiot, or a sharp kid who\\'s observing things closely and learning fast. This is the heart of the film, the relationship between the boy and the woman. Eventually, the boy will find out the self-important, hip swinging Xiao Jingbao is miserable. She is the beautiful songbird hopelessly trapped in a world where she is bathed in luxury by the ruthless Tang, with no hope of freedom. <br /><br /> The boy\\'s whole attitude changes when he realizes this, and the question the film poses from here is ... what, if anything, can he do about it? If this was an American film, (and I\\'d love to see such a version) probably plenty, but director Yimou Zhang is a cynical man with a dark outlook on life. All his films have downbeat endings, and this one is no exception. What really bothers me though, is that events take place that result in a complete shift in setting half way through the film, and that\\'s always a dangerous move in the cinema. And this abrupt shift comes at a time when things are just getting interesting in the nightclub, when Shuisheng realizes \"Miss\" is very unhappy. He might have been able to help her in the big city and spacious confines of the nightclub, but marooned on an island, there\\'s not much he can do. This is a good film, but I would have liked to see the plot move in a different direction in the second half.',\n",
              " b\"Does anyone remember the famous Star Trek episode, one of the earliest ones where an encounter with an anomaly in space leaves Enterprise crewman, Gary Lockwood with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men? If you'll remember he was abandoned on deserted asteroid. The Fury deals with a young man on the way to being another Gary Lockwood.<br /><br />Young Andrew Stevens has those abilities already, they just need to be focused and developed. Stevens is being raised by his widowed father Kirk Douglas who's a government agent. A raid while they're on vacation in the Mediterranean by some Arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by John Cassavetes to separate father from son. Stevens believes Dad has died, but Kirk doesn't swallow that so easy.<br /><br />Kirk's on the hunt for his son and the quest takes him to Chicago where people like Stevens with paranormal abilities are being studied and tested so the USA can have them as a weapon. Carrie Snodgrass and Charles Durning are working there as well. And so is Fiona Lewis who's been given personal charge of Stevens and develops the kid's libido as well as his telekinesis.<br /><br />Brian DePalma directed this film and it's a good one with outstanding performances by all the cast. Look for a good performance from Amy Irving as another young person with such abilities who literally makes Cassavetes fall apart at the end. And there's a memorable bit from a younger and thinner Dennis Franz before the gain of weight and loss of hair that we all know as Detective Andrew Sipowicz. Franz plays a Chicago police officer who's something of a doofus. <br /><br />Fans of Brian DePalma in particular and horror films in general will very much like The Fury.\",\n",
              " b\"Arrogant and despicable sleazeball control freak fetish photographer Roger Neale (a nicely slimy portrayal by Joseph Farrell), his perky assistant Maura Holloway (the delightfully spunky Rachael Robbins), amiable, morally uptight lug Sam Rogan (likable Rob Monkiewicz), and three beautiful models -- sweet, naive Bridget (the always adorable Misty Mundae), vacuous Lauren (blonde looker Heidi Kristoffer), and meek Jennifer (fetching brunette C.J. DiMarsico) -- go to a rundown and abandoned old building for a photo shoot. Of course, said building turns out to be haunted by vicious and depraved sadist Rossiter (a deliciously hammy turn by Kevin G. Shinnick). While the premise certainly has promise, alas said promise is severely undermined by writer/director Brett Piper's lackluster execution: the sluggish pace crawls along for the first two thirds of the picture, there's no spooky atmosphere to speak of, the special effects are strictly so-so, and the drab and uneventful script gets bogged down in a dull surplus of insipid talk. Only when Rossiter gets revived in the last third and begins brutally torturing the ladies does this flick finally start cooking, but by then it's too little too late to alleviate the general tedium. The cast do their best with the blah material, both Jon Greathouse's moody score and M.A. Morales' polished cinematography are up to speed, and there's a decent smattering of yummy female nudity (Misty in particular as usual looks quite scrumptious in her birthday suit), but overall this movie is too poky and plodding. A merely passable time-waster.\",\n",
              " b\"I found it hard to like anyone in this film. The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better. But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their life's tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions. It's not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it's merely an account of a true story that happened there. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.<br /><br />When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one's life. The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.<br /><br />The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers. To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter. Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press? How much of the downward spiral could've been prevented had she behaved more to the public's liking in the media? Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of film-making. But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy. What is infuriating is that it's not that difficult. Apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case. Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.<br /><br />Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophie's Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph. It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself. She frustrates us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling. It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her, but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the public's attention.<br /><br />She is married to a pastor, and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most. Initially, they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to God's will, kick-starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part. Whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify, so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well...<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen, but the Australian public plays the real leads here. Like punctuation for each plot advance, director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.<br /><br />This Golan-Globus docudrama is not particularly memorable. The setting's atmosphere doesn't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out. But it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public.\",\n",

              " b\"I had no expectations for this movie before I saw it, expect a high regard for Gary Cooper and director King Vidor, and neither disappointed me in this nice effort from them.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this story concerns married writer Gary Cooper --one not unlike F. Scott Fitzgerald -- who has lost his groove, and had his latest novel rejected by his publisher. He is forced to give up his Manhattan apartment and move back to the abandoned family homestead in Connecticut. There he meets a community of Polish immigrants, and slowly falls in love with beautiful young Polish girl Anna Sten, who he had hired to help around the house.<br /><br />My first thought about this movie as I watched it, was that the leading man was more beautiful than the leading lady, as Gary Cooper certainly looked fabulous and was photographed with great sensitivity. Cooper in his modern American clothes certainly had the upper hand over Sten, who was always wearing dowdy traditional Eastern European dresses and hats. She was almost completely covered up in these costumes for the duration, and it would have been a treat to see her in American garb.<br /><br />The speed that Cooper's character falls in love with the young girl is questionable, especially considering he has a beautiful, funny and intelligent wife played by Helen Vinson. Perhaps it's the Polish girl's youth and innocence he's attracted to, but I think he's not as heroic as the movie-makers intend him to be. The wife does leave him alone in snowy New England to work on his novel, but he needn't stab her in the back by falling in love with another. Cooper's character comes off somewhat of a cad, and I never was able to sympathize with him enough to make me really care about his final happiness.<br /><br />The movie paints the wife as a shallow but glamorous socialite, caring only for the next party of get-away weekend at his expense. But at about two-thirds into the movie and after she has read his manuscript, she has a strong and wonderful scene with Sten where she discusses the hypothetical endings for the novel. Vinson really shines in this scene, which includes one incredibly long take with at least three pages of dialog. I thought both Vinson and the often-maligned Sten made it all work very nicely. This was the moment when you can see the strength under the airy facade, of Vinson's character.<br /><br />The movie takes a very dark turn partway through, and some of the scenes really rise to the level of verbal and physical abuse, something I hadn't expected to see. But the production values are great, Greg Toland's camera work shines, and the locations and sets are really convincing.<br /><br />But what somewhat bothered me in its intensity were these two scenes with Sten and her family. How brutal is the scene where her father and Ralph Bellamy want her to watch Bellamy slaughter pigs? I mean she said about 5 times that it makes her sick, and they kept insisting. And then finally after she runs off -- she and the audience get to hear the sound effect of pigs squealing as they're being butchered. Didn't expect this movie to go there...<br /><br />And then when her father, who was introduced as an amiable figure, gets so angry at Sten that he slaps her face with such intensity. Seemed pretty violent by today's standards...<br /><br />Finally, I admire and still wonder about the ambiguous ending. Obviously, the Polish girl has died. Vinson is standing next to Cooper as he gazes out the window. She speaks to him and then he remembers aloud how Sten would look coming up to the house. He sees her in his imagination. The camera pulls back, and now Vinson is no longer in the room or the scene. Did she leave him after all? Did she decide she didn't want to stay with a man who had such a love for another woman?\",\n",
              " b\"I just watched Brooklyn Bound for the first time about half-hour ago and this film doesn't waste a minute of the film as every scene of this film are shot very well. The cinematography was great, it's meant for a film like this. the guy doing it clearly had the right idea and it works very well for low-budget. All of the acting was good - Jamie Hector(Paid In Full, HBO's The Wire) is VERY effective in his role as is the scarce Dean Winters(HBO's Oz) w/ some strong acting. After watching the Brooklynite Jamie Hector play out his part as the strong and silent Marlo opposite Wood Harris in The Wire, It was the straw that broke the camel's back in making me consider this movie even though I was pretty sold on the title itself. The film itself shows the hard times in Brooklyn and it shows the cultural diversity which makes the film so meticulous and the scenes in the projects can be compared to the likes of New Jersey Drive and Clockers only they used actual Brooklyn n!&&@s for the film. What I really loved about the movie was the fact that REAL NEW YORK STREET SLANG IS USED CORRECTLY!!! The film itself doesn't pull any punches and keeps it very real and for that I recommend this film to anyone who likes urban film - Brooklyn Bound is a gem under the radar....\",\n",

They either had no personality or were too bitchy. TAR's aim for diversity produced some of the most ridiculous array of contestants that I've seen. We had an equal helping of Muslims, handicapped, Indians, homos, and ho's. I hope they have better characters next season.\",\n",
              " b\"To say that this movie is a let down would be a tremendous understatement. Sitting on the shelves of various high street DVD outlets, resplendent in its Two Disc Special Edition packaging and with a back cover blurb that brings up director Yuen Woo Ping's work as fight choreographer on The Matrix Trilogy and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you have to give credit for the packaging department for luring you into a false sense of belief that this movie is a hitherto overlooked milestone in HK action. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />I've heard it compared to the similarly disastrous Speed 2. In truth, the only link between the two is the setting on a luxury liner. Unlike Speed 2, where the task of slowing the out of control vessel was central to the plot, here, the ship is little more than something big, large and isolated for Kenny Ho to run around in. And speaking of Ho, his role as lead action hero leaves a lot to be desired. While he can handle the gun play and martial arts with as much flair as his contemporaries, his facial expressions remain largely unchanged throughout. There is a back story involving his dead wife which could have granted him more sympathy, but it is so woefully mishandled it feels like something that was tacked on for no particular reason. Twenty minutes after the credits roll, it's unlikely you'll remember anything about him. Besides, how can you feel any backing for a man who is supposed to be a security chief, yet fails to stop the villains from massacring nearly every passenger on the boat?<br /><br />However, his co-star Elaine Lui really stands out. Not because she's a good actress you understand, but because her role as the comic relief slapstick foil backfires spectacularly as she becomes one of the most irritating screen heroines to appear in the Hong Kong Legends catalogue. A little bit of comedy in action films is okay now and again, but considering the ridiculously high bodycount and number of innocent people murdered in this movie, she seems very out of place. Her fight with Christy Chung for example is extremely tasteless, as Lui imitates martial arts stances and goes through a bumbling slapstick routine, mere minutes after a young girl watched her mother machine gunned before her eyes.<br /><br />All in all then, not worth the effort. The action sequences are decent enough, but a bland leading man, immensely irritating heroine and a complete absence of emotion result in a film that Yuen Woo Ping would most probably want to forget.\",\n",

It features first-class characters: the quirky Belle; Gaston, the hateful attractive villain; the Beast, a character one can\\'t help but feels sorry for; the enchanted objects - Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, and Lumiere, characters that bring a lighthearted quality to the movie. Beauty and the Beast also features excellent executed animation. It isn\\'t hard to tell all the talent, the sweat, and the heart that was put in this film. The ballroom sequence, and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is great in another aspect: it\\'s ageless.

One of the greatest examples of traditional animation in recent years, it will go down in history with other beautiful Disney masterpieces, like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, and Cinderella.',\n",
              " b\"After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good. But when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss. Patiently i waited for it's DVD release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing. The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. For a start the direction is appalling. There's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. I wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future. Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe normally the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends, but he just doesn't look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along. The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story.\",\n",
              " b'Indeed, not a bad documentary (barely a real film, the plot is just an excuse to the connection of the different flamenco scenes). Antonio Canales is surprisingly good as Caco, and the other characters are of no relevance to the story whatsoever. Orestes, Caco\\'s nephew with cerebral palsy, is actually Antonio Canales\\' nephew. Undoubtable epic flavor in this escape/flamenco journey. Good details, as the nice landscapes in Cadiz and the references to Caco\\'s relative \"exiled\" in the Spanish cities of North Africa. Great and not so commercial flamenco singers, such as La Paquera(R.I.P) and La Caita. Special attention to the closing song, \"Naci en Alamo\".',\n",
              " b'The screen icon is a police detective with a difference in this very moody and formidable thriller from writer / director Richard Tuggle. He portrays Wes Block, a loving and responsible father on one hand, and on the other a sex addict with a yen for prostitutes. He\\'s on the trail of a sex murderer, and realizes that he\\'s really not too different from this deviant.<br /><br />Tuggle illustrates the darkness inside many of us quite literally in this movie, to which anyone who\\'s seen this can agree. There\\'s even a line to that effect spoken by a minor character. It\\'s definitely a daring project for the actor, who\\'s solid and believable as always; he has an especially potent scene where he trashes a room in rage and frustration as he realizes the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />The movie doesn\\'t play out as one might expect. There\\'s not much of a sense of urgency, even as the bodies pile up. It takes a real psychological approach as we witness the deterioration of our central character, who at least gets a strong female character to relate to as Genevieve Bujolds\\' role is introduced into the plot. She does a creditable job as well, creating a kind of moral center and giving the movie a solid anchor.<br /><br />Eastwoods\\' own daughter Alison plays one of his two daughters in the movie, and she\\'s very good, foregoing any sort of \"cutesy\" routines that child performers can fall into. Also appearing in a supporting role is Dan Hedaya as a fellow detective, although he\\'s a little under-utilized.<br /><br />The killer himself is barely established as a character in the film, seen almost exclusively in the act of stalking and murdering his victims. We learn almost nothing about him, he has barely any dialog, and the end reveal is very fleeting, making him quite a mysterious entity indeed.<br /><br />The jazz score and the location shooting in New Orleans add a highly appropriate and engaging amount of flavor, and there\\'s a great climactic chase lit by a helicopter.<br /><br />It wasn\\'t altogether satisfying for me, but it\\'s an intriguing and steamy thriller and is certainly worth a watch.<br /><br />7/10',\n",
              " b'I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, yet keeping an attentive eye. I waited for the next awful special effect, or the next ridiculously clich\\xc3\\xa9d plot item to show up full force, so I could learn how not to make a movie.<br /><br />It seems when they set out to make this movie, the crew watched every single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good vs. evil movie ever made, and saw cool things and said: \"Hey, we can do that.\" For example, the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking, is the one car the protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown on to. The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it. The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways, happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP. Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. Then the guy protecting the VIP says \"Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?\" He gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies, he gets whacked in an almost comically clich\\xc3\\xa9 fashion. Then for no apparent reason, defying logic, convention, and common sense, the dumb ass VIP GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK!!! A lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn\\'t make sense. Transparent acting distanced me from the movie, as well as bad camera-work, and things that just make you go: \"Wow, that\\'s incredibly cheesy.\" Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1, because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.',\n",
              " b\"It's not the most terrible show ever, it's just not very good and one of those American sitcoms you're likely to forget in years to come. If you're bored, it might be worth watching but try and find something else first.<br /><br />The characters are annoying, it's hard to care about any of them as they're all so over the top and shouting all the time. Claude is too nice in an annoying way and why do the people with better jobs have to be the ones who are full of themselves? I actually prefer the horrible ones because occasionally they do actually make you laugh unlike Claude and her pals, complete misfits who's characters have been done before (the white geeky guy and the black strong mama type) it's all very safe, unoriginal and boring.<br /><br />Most of the episodes are about the same thing, the bitchy ones are horrible to the nice ones, the nice ones retaliate and they all learn a lesson..all without getting any work done. There are a few OK episodes and i tried to give this show a chance but there's so many other better things to watch out there, this is just an average sitcom with no x factor.\",\n",

The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless.<br /><br />I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me, as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. Lots of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either.<br /><br />Possibly there is something there that I totally missed. Otherwise I'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art.\",\n",
              " b'I truly consider Tightrope to be by far one of Eastwood\\'s best acting performances. He definitely DID deserve, that year, at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. And don\\'t be mistaken, Wes Block has nothing to do with Dirty Harry ... true, these two cops both have their \"dark side\" -an aspect that Eastwood has learned to exploit in a number of his pictures, BUT Wes Block appears to be much more \"human\" than Harry. This single father is struggling with his own demons, persuaded that until now he has screwed up about everything in his life, beginning with his marriage ... he\\'s trying real hard to be a good father, as well as a good cop, that is until this killer comes along and threatens all he\\'s been fighting for to preserve.<br /><br />Here we get to know a guy who\\'s extremely vulnerable, hurt, un-self confident, haunted and whose relationship with women remains ambiguous, based on control, kind of as if he was afraid of them, of what they could do to him, seeing them as a threat ... hence his resort to the services of prostitutes and his use of handcuffs on them.<br /><br />As usual in Eastwood\\'s movies, we wanna know what\\'s underneath this front his characters put on ... -like in Pale Rider, Josey Wales, The Bridges of Madison County ... the silences, the puzzling, haunting, deep looks, that tell us far more about a character than any word would. \"Less is more\" is definitely a guideline of this movie. Most of the time, Eastwood\\'s characters reveal themselves through their silences, and it\\'s particularly true here.<br /><br />I believe there\\'s a line in Tightrope that sums up pretty accurately what Eastwood\\'s movies are really about: \"I\\'m not sure how close I wanna get ...\" They\\'re about very private men struggling with life.<br /><br />This movie is simply one of his best.',\n",
              " b'Robert Culp (they call his character \"doctor\"...I think he\\'s a vet or something) and family move to an affluent, low-tax, zero-law-enforcement suburb. Lantern-jawed Culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and \"go cruising\" through his front yard at 60mph. He presses charges, which arouses the kids\\' ire, and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign.<br /><br />Marilyn Manson, er, Marlyn Mason rather, plays his fretful, boiled-celery wife, who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses, and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But The System is getting Culp nowhere, and he\\'s not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what movie people do when The System fails...(but this is based on a true story, which makes it even better).<br /><br />It should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient \\'70s funk-o-matic \"teenage\" theme music that warns us when they\\'re up to no good, this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even-handedly (really!). It doesn\\'t make a big generational thing out of it. Kudos for that.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice, and you like fire, and you like justice for dogs by way of fire, and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are \"too damn soft,\" then this flick\\'s ethos is up your alley. No, it\\'s not really \"good,\" at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word. There\\'s nothing subtle or understated or clever about it, it\\'s just sort of a feature-length PSA for vigilantism. It does, however, capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other, beloved works. Remember in Frank Miller\\'s The Dark Knight Returns when Batman leads the Mutants on horseback to reclaim Gotham City? Remember that scene in A Christmas Story where the kid pounds the bully\\'s face in? Remember how cool that was? Or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors? Yeah, mon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was a 1973 made-for-TV movie that I just happened to catch at 4am on my local WB affiliate, and it\\'s probably not destined for DVD release. But after being inspired by this film, do you think I\\'m gonna just sit here and take it!?!',\n",
              " b'The very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist, and my thought was: \"This is almost too beautiful.\" And it goes on like this: Images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each of them perfect in every detail. Even the girl\\'s room, her father\\'s car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This could seem outdated and escapistic, but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty, happening on the border between life and fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of it. The extreme parsimony of the movie, having a simple, slow story, just one actor and hardly any special effects, exerted a strong magic. I therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as a grown-up woman, and her son) are introduced. Another shortcoming is the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I couldn\\'t bring an English pop-song together with French mountain glory. I went to the movie together with my two small daughters, but I recommend it to adults as well, given that they appreciate this kind of movie. Obviously, not everybody does.',\n",

And of course, this movie has some young stud that can really ride a car. And what else can we put in this movie, yes, one young hot girl that is a car mechanic. Not only a car mechanic, but a car mechanic that wears as little as she can, while SHE WELDS. Yes, I have heard that that is a really good idea. If you look away from the small plot holes and stuff like that, this movie isn't as bad as the Fast and Furious movies, but it is still not good. Don't really know what Dennis Hopper is doing in this movie, but I doubt that he is proud of it. But if you are a car nut and about the age of 18, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you don't like movies like Fast and Furious and Biker Boyz etc, stay as far away as you can. I rate this movie 3/10\",\n",

However, as a piece of film, and wax needs to do research, Che illustrates the man who fought for Cuba's people. While you may disagree with the ideology, the movie is amazing. Filmed in Puerto Rico and other amazing locations, Benicio's Che is a man with a mission from beginning to end when he is shot in Bolivia.<br /><br />I do not agree with what Che did in real life and I do not wear a Che tshirt; however, that should not prevent you from seeing this movie.<br /><br />It is easy to criticize a historical figure without understanding all sides. Please do not let a biased comment prevent you from seeing another great movie by Soderbergh and Benicio del Toro.<br /><br />Supporting roles from Catalina Sandino Moreno and Demian Bichir make this a must see. <br /><br />The editing could be improved if indeed this will be shown in two parts when as a whole, it is amazing.\",\n",

The \"hollow\" crowd reaction at film\\'s end did indeed echo my own assessment of a cliche\\' ridden and drawn out relationship journey. I get the feeling that there may be more of a West coast-East coast dichotomy at work here. Free LOVE ( at a cost ! ), and a \"lacking\" morality.... when further delved upon , seem to stand out to those involved [like the brightest of highway billboards] , yet seemingly and blindly passed over by most of those involved , like non-stick teflon brain tissue ! Marguerite Moreau , although a talented actress , falls short in this faux pas , with a weak supporting cast. Again, perhaps us \"eastcoasters\" have a harder time grasping others missing the obvious and a lack of patience , there of. Gauged my own reaction to those of others in the mixed and diverse crowd screening it there. In discussion with many college students in attendance there, most left with gaping mouths, but waking up to the joys and truths of : Trust , family , monogamy & common sense and sensibilities ! <br /><br />',\n",

Classic baddies such as \"The Creeping Terror,\" \"The Mighty Gorga\" and \"Manos\" are uniformly bad from start to finish. \"Hobgoblins\" on the other hand, starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept \"Club Scum\" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. With just this one film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time.

If you are curious, perhaps a rental from Netflix, but this film is definitely not for keeps.<br /><br />If you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your Asian American film awareness, and came away disappointed, then I recommend the following films for your personal viewing.

This film is well-acted (especially by the two leads) and utterly engaging. I agree parts of the plot were wafer thin but it presented as a fairytale and a cracking good one at that. It was just joyful and poignant and above all uplifting.

Unhappily, the scriptwriters pretended that they knew better than Forsyth how to tell a story, and they got rid of the mining guy's story, of old Manson's greed and of young Manson's lust, and of the tribal question story, in exchange for a meaningless story about Shannon's wife, and the one of the pain-in-the-ass journalist who gets killed, which distracts the spectator's attention. As a result, the special effects/explosion specialist is given a free hand in a pitiful attempt to fill the holes in the story with smoke and fire...

Cast and the core of the story were really not bad....not bad..actually that's, what this movie was. But it could have been really great. It was not because the actors sometimes could not be convincing enough. Actually it was not an actor-problem, but more a screenplay- or director-problem. The adjustment of the original story with a standard hollywood-template simply was too obvious. The atmosphere was not bad, but it was not really continuous. The cuban flair and atmosphere of the setting also could have been brought to the screen in a more intense way. So it lacked the great excitement. But you always can do it better. In fact it was a really romantic, erotic, entertaining and thrilling lovestory (sorry...a story about love ;-)).

Normally I would never Pay to see a movie twice.<br /><br />This action adventure thrill ride is near and dear to any guy/girl who is young at heart. The story combined with thrills made the movie easy to relate to. The Flyboys is definitely the best adventure movie I have scene ever, and that is coming from a film major who sees movies all the time. The story had the viewers demanding for what came next and on the edge through out the entire movie.<br /><br />The way that this movie connects to you, is how you can relate to it. The characters and choice of the characters was great and they worked together amazingly well as if they knew each other their entire life. Most times after you see a independent film there is always one character that stands out due to bad acting. This did not exist, and let the viewer instantly connect with the characters as if they were sitting next to them. <br /><br />With out spoiling the movie I need to Jump to the Creator Rocco DeVilliers. Rocco has created a movie that looks like it required 100 million but only done with two million. He has made a film that was made over the course of 7 years. His movie has beaten all the other independent films at the festivals I have been to. I walked out of all the other movies saying that was good but not as good as \"The Flyboys\". <br /><br />The question remains why hasn\\'t the movie been released in theaters every where? The answer is \"LA won\\'t take it\" . After hearing Rocco say this at both film festivals the audience was instantly appalled and began to boo.<br /><br />The best thing that you can do after reading this review is to watch \"The Flyboys\". With out spoiling the movie I could not give a in depth review to prove to you how well this film was made, but at least now you know what you can do to help the progress of this wonderful film.<br /><br />PS. the guy who said this would be better than the new Indiana Jones, he was absolutely right.',\n",
              " b'oh my god, i give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons. the final sequence is once again quite effectively handled and it was absolutely hilarious. that is what it gets those three points for. other than that, it was atrocious. it wasnt meant to be this funny, that much is obvious, but the dubbing, the acting of the dubbed voices, the dialogue they said, where often hilarious. the actions performed, and/or not performed also lead to much hilarity and/or throwing things at the screen. such as when the whole town is being slaughtered and one small group of people stand on a balcony looking on as if they were watching a cooking glass, or the \"attempted\" escapes from the church in which they hole up.<br /><br />evil mayor: i think something is going on outside so you should go upstairs and look out the window.<br /><br />hero: ok.<br /><br />evil mayor: now is my chance to make some idiot go outside and flail around with fire being totally ineffective and getting hacked up.<br /><br />insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />evil mayor: damn, wait, i will get this small child and she will walk outside and cry pappa seemingly obvlious to the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers but are actually zombies with no flesh or skin or anything and she will lead them away and i will flee! insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />hero (upstairs): he is trying to escape again, fool, and he has left the door open, he is silly, this is a nice view.<br /><br />woman: where is my daughter?<br /><br />hero (downstairs now): i dont know, i cannot see her anyway and she was not outside because i could not see her despite her being out there and me having a view of the entire neighbourhood and she is standing right outside, where on earth could she be?<br /><br />needless to say, anybody would be throwing things at the screen after 10 minutes of this. so, watch the first film with a couple of friends, having a few drinks, and make sure by the time you get to watching this one, you are absolutely blindly drunk and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all. and there wasnt even any decent gore, such a shame.',\n",
              " b'John Mudoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a bathtub completely naked, with blood dripping down his forehead, unaware of what is happening, he remembers nothing. In the next room he finds a dead body and a blood stained knife. What follows is john trying to piece together what is happening to him and what he unravels is one of the greatest science fiction stories ever put to film. There is a group called the strangers who have an ability to physically change surroundings of them and the people living in the city, they call this ability \"tuning\". They soon discover that john also has this ability, which is impossible as it would take a normal human a few lifetimes to gain the ability to \"tune\". Thats the most i can tell without giving away major plot points.<br /><br />The movie is set in a 1940ish looking city where detectives are hunting John, along with the mysterious strangers. The tall buildings and the knowledge that the strangers could be anywhere in the city gives a menacing ambiance, heightening the tension in the movie and giving off a great effect on the viewer. The special effects in Dark City are stunning and realistic, especially when certain characters use \"tuning\".<br /><br />Rufus Sewell gives a good performance as John Murdoch, though i could\\'nt help feeling he was holding back somewhat. I could think of a few other actors who could have gave a much better performance but he was generally good.<br /><br />Kiefer Sunderland as Dr. Daniel Schreber was very good and seemed to have put all of his effort into his character, its quite an unusual role for Sunderland but he pulls it off pretty well.<br /><br />Another performance worth mentioning is Richard O\\'Brien as Mr Hand, he gives a genuinely creepy performance as one of the main strangers, i thought i would see him and think crystal maze through all of his scenes but he does a pretty good job of playing a convincing character.<br /><br />Overall the movie leaves a few unanswered questions, leaving the viewer to conduct their own theories about the outcome of events. I have a good grasp of the story as a whole but some people will find bits and pieces confusing. A great film anyways, i gave it an 8 because it tends to drag in some spots, but the end makes up for all doubts.',\n",
              " b'Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great), the personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture through time). What is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance: chucking mainstream American culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.<br /><br />I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, putting on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night. Often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script off sheets of paper. Sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. I was never happier. Except for the hooting and hollering, seeing \\'Riding Giants\\' took me back in time.<br /><br />IT also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge, not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder, not keeping up with the Joneses, pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question, \"what is the purpose of life?\" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: to live life solely on our own terms. Maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.<br /><br />It was this message that really impressed me.',\n",

This movie had just as much passion and love for the game and the characters as the other one. Great camera work, amazing/thrilling moments throughout all to form a great movie experience!!! Definitely worth the watch for any soccer fan. All characters are well presented, and the movies plot is not lost throughout as young Munez finds his way as a real first class soccer player. My favorite part of this movie is that all of my favorite players are seen as players who play with Munez.',\n",

I am not one of the average guys who are only interested in hardcore action, or something else advertised right... My mind is open to almost any movie, but crap! This movie is about as original as my post for it ( not original lol)...I saw another \"Chick Flick\" around that same time called \"Down with Love\" and enjoyed that one, one hundred times better. In \"View From the Top\" the characters were terrible and undeveloped completely. The plane could have crashed in the movie and I definitely wouldn\\'t have shed one tear of sympathy for Christine or any of the other flight attendants on board...DON\\'T LET YOUR GIRLFRIEND DRAG YOU INTO THIS ONE!! lol 2 out of 10...got the 2 because of Mike Myres\\'s small part.',\n",

Not good, not good at all. I can say however, that Edinburgh looks fabulous, but then it always does. The story lines are predictable, clich\\xc3\\xa9d, and very dull - throw in a priest/actor with serious misgivings about his vocation, a couple of likely lad Irish comedians, a bit of gratuitous homosexual sex, a ditsy blonde with useless jokes, and a weedy leading lady trying to 'act' and you have a recipe for an absolute turkey. This is one I won't be returning to for the leftovers... it should have left in a car park it certainly doesn't deserve your hard-earned cash. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it.\",\n",
              " b'A taut and topical political thriller that, unfortunately, goes off the rails.<br /><br />In its defense, the basic premise is plausible, the writing is tense and dramatic, and the acting and direction are professional. Other posters have complained about implausibilities in the plot, and the wrong names used for things. A political thriller must have some unexpected twists or there would be no story, and we can assume that the \"H2O\" world has different names for things like the RCMP and War Measures Act.<br /><br />The series, however, goes off the rails in the third hour. We can accept one or two extremely implausible events if the story requires it, but when near-impossible events happen again and again, with a new one each few minutes, credibility crumbles. Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.<br /><br />I\\'ll give an example. An assassin is killing anyone, no matter how powerful or insignificant, who threatens the conspiracy. One of the major characters is a police detective who is about to unravel the plot. The assassin traps her, spills clues about the conspiracy, and then lets her go. This is an absurd Hollywoodism, like something from an old Flash Gordon serial. There are even bigger howlers in the series, and I know what happens later, but this is the one that made me want to throw something at the TV.<br /><br />The series plays like it was written by a committee, and each member wanted to get their plot twist in whether it made sense or not. The ending is a disappointment too; there is yet another plot twist in the last few minutes and the story just stops. All the viewer is left with is a huge number of unresolved plot twists.',\n",
              " b\"I had doubts about this movie the moment it started. I recorded it because it was rated highly in the TV listings and starred Matthau, who I always like, but during the opening credits' bucolic scenes of Matthau playing with a little boy to the movie's unutterably treacly score (the sort of thing you heard in TV movies of the 70s) I thought, oh god, what am I in for? Matthau's windbag character also instantly turned me off. So I came here to see what people thought, and saw one glowing review after another. And that inspired me to watch another hour before giving up.<br /><br />Besides the truly abysmal score, Kotch suffers from a surfeit of annoying characters. Kotch himself is genial but tedious, his son is bland and his daughter-in-law plays the requisite bitch. The girl he eventually helps is about as annoying as the title character.<br /><br />I can't figure out why people like this movie so much. I think it's a movie for people who like comforters with teddy bears quilted into them or something. It's simple-minded and just plain dull.\",\n",

As I sat and watched it I was mesmerized by Patrick Deweare! The movie and his performance touched something very deep in me, I became an instant fan of his and the memory of that movie stayed with me for years. I purchased the movie as an adult. I think it was the deep sadness that emanated from him, just the sad looks he would convey without actually speaking. I love this movie as much today as I did at 14, which at that time I did not know that he had just died. With the advent of the Internet I was able to find out much more about this man who's performance haunted me and learned where that sadness came from.\",\n",
              " b'My third viewing of this masterpiece some time ago revealed to me just how brilliant it really is. Expertly directed, well-crafted, and featuring an intriguing story, State of Grace was unfortunately overlooked upon it\\'s debut in 1990 in favor of more well-known gangster films, such as Goodfellas and the bookend to Coppola\\'s epic Godfather trilogy.<br /><br />I\\'m not sure how a film of this caliber can go so grossly overlooked, even nowadays (though, as is the case with many films, it\\'s appreciation has been snowballing the last few years.) All I can say is that it has quickly propelled itself to the elite of my favorite films, and I consider myself lucky to have it sitting in my DVD shelf. <br /><br />State of Grace was one of the earliest films that depicted the Irish mob, a topic that, so far, has an impeccable track record at being transitioned to the screen: Miller\\'s Crossing, a masterpiece by the Coen Brothers that arrived the same year as this film and was also criminally overlooked, 2003\\'s Road to Perdition, Sam Mendes\\' beautiful father/son epic, and, most recently, Martin Scorsese\\'s triumphant return to the genre with his slick adaptation of Hong Kong blockbuster, The Departed. <br /><br />State of Grace takes place in the gritty environment of Hells Kitchen, New York City. Terry Noonan (Sean Penn) is an undercover cop from Boston, on a mission to infiltrate one of the top crime organizations headed by Frankie Flannery (Ed Harris) and his brother, Jackie (Gary Oldman), Noonan\\'s boyhood pals. While in town, Terry falls into his old ways with Jackie, and requests that Frankie put him on the payroll as a worker. He also rekindles his relationship with the brothers\\' sister, Kate (Robin Wright.) <br /><br />As Terry becomes more and more entrenched in the underground affairs of Frankie and Jackie, his morals become devastatingly conflicted. He finds that his allegiance to his pals is at ends with his job assignment. His devotion to either is constantly tested. Things take a turn, however, when Frankie\\'s psychotic methods and attempts to align with a powerful Italian syndicate reveal him to be worse than Terry imagined, and he takes matters into his own hands. <br /><br />Specific mention of the top three actors deserves marquee attention. It is rare that you\\'ll find a cast headlined by as talented a trio as that of State of Grace. Sean Penn, Ed Harris, and Gary Oldman are all their most fierce, and rarely have either of them been better. Each brings something different that is crucial to the movie\\'s success, and the entire package would have been brought down severely without either of them. Penn\\'s tortured cop, who finds himself reverting more and more to the old lifestyle that he tried to get away from, is the crux of the movie. The anguish and guilt that he keeps bottled up inside him really conveys how difficult a situation he is in. Harris adds another level to the cold, calculating mob boss. His sadistic nature is matched beautifully with a fear he protrudes subtly. And Gary Oldman, who never requires any commendation, is, as always, spectacular. He steals every frame of the movie he\\'s in as the impulsive, hot-headed brother/best friend who values little in life, except family and the task at hand. As Harris brings \"cold\" to another level, Oldman supplies an entirely new definition of \"crazy\". All of the work done by each of these talents shows why they are considered some of the best in the business. <br /><br />The supporting cast deserves recognition. The three leads are backed by an impressive cast of character actors, who lend fervently to the style and attitude of the film. Superb character actors John Turturro and John C. Reilly make whatever impressions the lead three allow them, and Robin Wright is a smoldering pillar of sensuality as Penn\\'s love interest (soon to be his wife in real life), and she fleshes out a bit of back story. Burgess Meredith and R.D. Call are also superb. <br /><br />Ennio Morricone is at hand, and while his score here is not his best (certainly not a bad thing), it really adds to the feel of the movie; first played over the opening credits over a St. Patrick\\'s Day parade in slow motion, and reoccurring throughout the film, it is a nostalgic, haunting theme that takes us to times past and reminds us of the contexts of the scenario. <br /><br />The cinematography done by Jordan Cronenworth is strangely beautiful, making the well-played grit of the urban area look appealing. A shade of blues dominates the look of the film and gives it a glossy luster. <br /><br />The finale finds Penn marching to a bar in slow motion to the beat of and through a St. Patrick\\'s Day parade, followed by a shootout inter-spliced with footage of the parade, and it is one the coolest, most adrenaline-pumping scenes ever put to celluloid. <br /><br />It\\'s too bad this gem isn\\'t recognized more, because it\\'s a real treat. I\\'ve found a new perennial favorite, one that is perfect for every third Thursday in March. <br /><br />The Italian mafia films are great, but it\\'s great to have a few standing points on the board for us Irish.<br /><br />Erin Go Bragh!',\n",

Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!!

There were fantastic moments, some great innovations, and, for my money, one beautiful song (Sandman's Coming)...but COME ONE - <br /><br />The scene in the courtroom where people are throwing glowing money around and legal people are dancing on the bench, dock, etc? It's a moment that only Ed Wood could love.<br /><br />If anyone wants to disagree with me - great - maybe I missed something - it's been a long time since I've seen it. <br /><br />I must say, though, that Cop Rock was one of the biggest disasters in entertainment - well intentioned, well produced, but ultimately a disaster.\",\n",
              " b'This film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life. We get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don\\'t just happen on the front.<br /><br />Luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents went through during a war. This film, I think, is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like a young Peter O\\'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. It\\'s definitely worth listening to him recite \"High Flight\" and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with Shakespeare.',\n",

Wow, what genius. And while the movie is full of plot-holes (for instance, a few clips of a t-Rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where Pappy finds a torture chamber, screams \"Colin\\'s a girl!\" and runs out) I will never forget the brilliance that is Raptor Planet. Thank you Sci-Fi for another classic.',\n",

For a change, Paulette Goddard plays the nurse with most of the male admirers (Sonny Tufts in particular), with Veronica Lake showing up late in a decidedly unsexy role (about which I can\\'t say much more than that, lest I ruin it for you). Both offer up career performances, if that\\'s saying much. Their leader, durable talent Claudette Colbert, holds the troop together throughout, despite numerous tragedies. Helping to prop *her* up is her persistent suitor George Reeves (later of the TV series, \"Superman\"). Interesting for the fact that it was shot while the war was still raging ~ so there are a lot of decidedly non-PC references to \"Japs\" ~ but this is a real salute to the unsung women who served in \"the big one.\" A must-rent.<br /><br />4 Stars.',\n",
              " b'First off, Robot Chicken is the ultimate parody show. There are no real story lines. The episodes consist completely of various parody skits and sketches. The sketches last 6-7 minutes tops. Most of them only last a few seconds to a minute! They animators use only toys and clay figures which, in my opinion, adds to the hilarity. And it\\'s packed with senseless violence that shames even Mortal Kombat. Batman, Robin, the Mario Brothers, Brittany Spears, N\\'Sync, Hillary Duff, Fred Flintsone, the Little Drummer Boy, The Nutcracker and even Cap\\'n Crunch and Tony the Tiger have all been brutally killed by the twisted creators of the show. So often the violence is completely pointless. For example, in one skit we see a trio of kids enjoying their \"Phillis Diller Spray n Play\" sprinkler. Suddenly, the sprinkler goes haywire and kills all three of the kids in completely disgusting manners that left me breathless from laughing so hard. The tentacles on the sprinkler impale one kid\\'s chest, rip the shin off the second kid and tear open the head of the third kid. In another skit, a granny fights her fellow senior citizens in a massive nursing home for absolutely no reason. Nothing is safe from the geniuses behind the show. They even find ways to make children\\'s franchises such as the Carebears and Clifford the Big Red Dog excessively violent. There\\'s way too much to even go to detail on but if you like senseless violence and carnage, this show is for you!',\n",

              " b'\"Der Clown\" is the movie version of the German TV \\xc2\\x96 series by the same name, running quite successful from 1996 to 2001. The series was about some guy who is officially dead but in truth is sitting in his hideout, waiting for the bad guys to move. Whenever something is seriously wrong, he\\'ll put on a clown mask and go rampage, vigilante \\xc2\\x96 style. So far, so good, on to the Big Screen...<br /><br />A merry bunch of bad guys with hockey masks wants to steal the German gold reserves. The guy who once was the Clown has retired after his girlfriend was killed in action, but now it\\'s time for him to take his costume out of the vault, put on the smelly rubber mask again and kick some bad butt.<br /><br />Boy, this has gone wrong. Big time trash bonanza! First of all, it was not shot on 35 mm, it does not even look like 16 mm, I have a certain feeling that they did it on video. Bad video, that is, with the predominant colours being red (explosions, the actors\\' faces) and grey (everything else). It looks terrible, but on the other hand, that fits quite well with about all other aspects of this production. The movie desperately tries in every scene to imitate big loud Hollywood action flicks (which is absolutely okay), but obviously the makers neither have the talent nor have they understood anything (not okay). Every five minutes there is a big, red (you know, video) explosion or something, our heroes escape one way or the other, with always the same pathetic piece of score. I would accept that those scenes do not have any kind of emotional impact, but the movie does not even work as an entertaining no-brainer, never! And whose fault is this? Yes. Send in the director, writer, editor and all the other clowns responsible for this catastrophe! May they lower their red video faces in shame!<br /><br />The screenplay was obviously written by a chimp that was tied to a typewriter. It reveals a total lack of sense for pace, logic, characters, dialog, you name it. There is absolutely no storytelling. You could zap into this crap every time, stay with it for five minutes and change the channel again, without the feeling that you\\'re missing something before or after what you just watched, it has made-for-TV written all over (Afterwards I even had problems to summarize the story at all...). This terrible excuse for a script is turned into an uninspired, uninterrupted inferno of hectic, shaky shots. Honestly, I saw home movies that had more virtuosity than this. Heck, not even the action sequences look good! The most annoying thing however is the extensive, completely unmotivated use of time warps and split screen effects throughout the whole movie (I don\\'t mean two or three times, it is in almost EVERY scene). And for those who are still with us: The sound mixing is the worst I was forced to listen to in years. Bad, bad, bad!<br /><br />But I wouldn\\'t say that it is not entertaining. \"Der Clown\" features tons of incredible, unintentionally funny moments, e.g. a stunt, where at least a dozen burning police cars fly through the cloud of an explosion (red, of course) on a highway. Yes, this is a cool stunt. No, it is by no means a tragic, emotional scene which would maybe, and only maybe, justify the use of slow motion and pathetic syntheziser strings for two long minutes. It however gets really, really tasteless when the main character has a flashback of how his girlfriend died. This is edited like a music video, with the lethal bullet entering the girl\\'s body within the rhythm of the music. My god, what were they thinking??<br /><br />If you\\'re into trash and maybe even survived last year\\'s moron fiesta \"Daniel \\xc2\\x96 Der Zauberer\", this is definitely a must see. If not, be warned. You\\'ll probably feel the urge to go rampage afterwards, vigilante \\xc2\\x96 style.',\n",

True, the old age make up is dreadful, and the last five minutes seriously weaken the impact of the film, but the sum total is moving and perceptive.<br /><br />Bette Midler, giving the performance of her career to date, was robbed of the Oscar in my opinion. It is a brave and sincere effort on her part, and such a pity that it was not met with greater recognition. James Caan plays the shallow, slightly dim Eddie Sparks almost too well. There are times when he truly frightened me. The performances on the whole are restrained; when the occasion for histrionics comes, both stars rise to it.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended. I sincerely hope this film finds its audience one day.',\n",

It had a wonderful premise: Wife needs transplant, Husband will do anything to make sure she gets it.<br /><br />However, the execution of the script was poor. There are numerous unneeded scenes of sex with A LOT of flesh (but no nudity -- go figure). The dialog was trite and not believable. There are characters that appear briefly to move the story along with no explanation of who they are.<br /><br />And the ending. No spoiler, but you could see it coming RIGHT at you -- and unfortunately it couldn't be dodged. The last 2 minutes of the film are painfully inane and hard to watch.\",\n",
              " b'I believe the title speaks for itself. Date Movie has indeed earned a well deserved place in IMDb\\'s bottom 100. The film is packed with disgusting images that would make any decent human being sick to his or her stomach. From the cat humping a nearly mummified corpse to Eddie Griffin spitting out a mammoth hairball in slow motion, the humor in this movie is downright distasteful. Sure, everyone needs a dumb comedy to laugh at once in a while, but there is nothing funny about the family cat raping Grandma\\'s freeze-dried remains.<br /><br />There are several moments in this movie that could be funny were they not dramatically overdone. For instance, when the cat is sitting on the toilet with diarrhea for two whole minutes. It was comical for the first thirty seconds, but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end. Even more so is the opening sequence when Alyson Hannigan is dancing through the street in a fat-suit. No offense\\xc2\\x97I\\'m a bit on the heavy side myself\\xc2\\x97but no one wants to see a soaking wet obese woman dancing on her hands and knees. In the dinner scene, Adam Campbell\\'s orgasmic and continuous shouts of \"YES!\" are awkward to watch. Judah Friedlander plays Nicky, a fat slob covered from head to toe in grease stains who states one of the most disgusting lines of the film, \"When I think about the honeymoon my sac gets all tingly and s--t.\" That\\'s just nasty. Carmen Electra\\'s parody of Paris Hilton\\'s car washing commercial for the Hardee\\'s thick burger is sickening and it is shown in at least four flashbacks throughout the film. It\\'s simply overkill.<br /><br />To its credit, this film does have some key elements that most audiences enjoy in a movie. Boy meets girl, boy thinks girl is beautiful, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl face obstacles in their relationship, boy and girl overcome said obstacles, and they all live happily ever after. Sadly, this film could have been something enjoyable, but it instead we are faced with this warped piece of trash that only the most sick and uncouth can laugh at. This is a movie that will mean absolutely nothing to future generations (if it even exists to them at all). Yes, it had potential, but it turned out to be something repulsive.<br /><br />Really, Date Movie doesn\\'t deserve the attention it\\'s getting from me writing this review. I\\'m trying to impress upon all movie-goers what a saddening waste of time this film is. I heard warnings from friends, critics, and fellow movie buffs, but like an idiot I watched it anyway. Don\\'t make the same mistake I did. And if you are so curious that you decide to watch it against your better judgment, don\\'t eat before doing so.',\n",
              " b\"A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.\",\n",

It was a Friday evening and after a long working week, I threw myself on the lounge with my wife and switched on the television for some brain numbing trashy entertainment. After channel surfing for a while - and an elbow from the wife who took charge of the remote control - we settled on this film, DINNER WITH FRIENDS.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a horror film about friends and divorces. I cringed at certain parts that were related to our lives, and most of all, I understood the pain of it all. There were times when I just wanted to get up and lose myself in the WWW of my computer, but I had to see this movie out.<br /><br />Apart from the film trying hard not to be too stage orientated, it was thought provoking cinema. In my world the dialog was precise. The acting, classic new age Hollywood bravado mixed with the old school! And the direction, very unobtrusive and it just got on with the story.<br /><br />At the end of it all, you know the film succeeded when it creates discussions and heated debates with your partner.

              " b\"The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts. It is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan (as played by Clint Eastwood) so popular. He carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, Harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing. But it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen. And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `Sudden Impact,' directed by and starring Eastwood, so successful. In this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception: Whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.<br /><br />In his own inimitable way, Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time. So he does; as only `Dirty Harry' can. In a small town north of San Francisco, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O. employed by the perpetrator. Unaccountably, Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief, Jannings (Pat Hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere. Not one to be deterred, however, Harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke). Gradually, Harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture?<br /><br />Eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `Dirty Harry.' It had been seven years since the last `Harry' offering (`The Enforcer,' 1976), but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor. And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4. As with all the films he directs, Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end. <br /><br />The screenplay, by Joseph Stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `Dirty Harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith) is the most engaging since the original `Dirty Harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action. The characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of Harry's best catch-phrases: `Go, ahead-- make my day...'<br /><br />As Harry, Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular: He lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today. Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before. No matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry, or at least have him around. `Dirty Harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, Eastwood `is' Dirty Harry, without question, just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone, Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.' She manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre. Even amid the violence, Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life. Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood's Harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.<br /><br />In supporting roles, two performances stand out: Paul Drake, as Mick, creates the best `psycho' since Andy Robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `Dirty Harry.' With actually very limited screen time, Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience. This is the guy you can't wait to see Harry take care of in the end. Also effective is Audrie J. Neenan, who makes her character, Ray Parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city. It's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell (Horace), Mark Kevloun (Bennett) and Nancy Parsons (Mrs. Kruger). With a perfect blend of drama and action, `Sudden Impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience. 9/10.\",\n",
              " b'\"The Visitor\" holds a rare distinction: of the thousands of films I\\'ve seen as a paying moviegoer and paid critic, it is probably the one at the VERY bottom of the barrel. Compared to this, \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and other Ed Wood movies come across as masterpieces of celluloid art. A weird Italian-American ripoff of the horror/sci-fi cycle of the \\'70s (from \"Omen\" to \"Close Encounters\"), this movie looks as though it was made by a hallucinating crew that tossed the old script and started with a new one every day. There is virtually no continuity - and most of the big Hollywood names apparently working for scale and by the day (Shelley Winters, John Huston, Glenn Ford, Sam Peckingpah, etc.) stagger very briefly about looking hung over and very confused. For years, I thought my dim recollections of this movie were a bad dream; but IMDb proves I actually DID sit through this, ah, epic. The most vivid memory I have of it, for some reason, is Shelley Winters doing a perky rendition of \"Shortn\\'ng Bread.\" Nelson Eddy must have spun in his grave - and if was dead yet, that probably killed him!',\n",

What it has is possibly the best combination of the above in any action movie every made. It takes the pieces that it has to work with and forms a better whole. The dialogue is good. The cast is good (Rickman is the best of the bunch). The plot is good. Together, they are great. This film is the benchmark by which all American action movies should be judged. If an action film is better than Die Hard, then it deserves to be praised for that achievement alone.<br /><br />I rate it a 8.5/10 in it's genre. I gave it a 9 here.\",\n",

              " b'I waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /><br />I found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary. It did what it set out to do, show me something I had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored. I knew nothing of the Drag world and finding out about them and the \"Balls\" was just spectacular to me. These folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. The catty folks, the complainers (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the Drag Queen was wearing wasn\\'t a man\\'s coat!), the jealous, it\\'s all there like in every other competition. LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPETITION like it. Which I felt was a point.<br /><br />You had the older drag queen talking about how the Balls \"used\" to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the Balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was that important to them! Then there was sad stories, stories of who\\'s \"house\" and \"house mother\" brought out the best and the brightest in competition. It was interesting.<br /><br />Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, I lived through the so called \\'Madonna\\' craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her \"Vogue\" phase and rightfully so. If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldn\\'t have HAD a \"Vogue\" phase, I know that now. Credit should be given where credit is DUE. Makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary, they\\'ll learn they\\'re not as \"mainstream\" as they think.',\n",

Although he would go on to become one of the more delightful actors of the \\'30s and \\'40s, he shows little promise of that here, nor any sign of talent acquired during his previous 25 films.<br /><br />A prologue announces the virtuous intention of depicting a moral scourge so that an informed public can combat it--but this is clearly just a CYA that allows the intriguingly-named \"Personality Pictures\" company to run this cheesy exploitation flick past the already toothless production code office.<br /><br />Maude Lindsay (Almeda Fowler) runs a \"party girl\" service for business functions, and she tries to send her hootchiest coochies to the United Glass soiree. (The only real humor in the entire film comes from her secretary continually addressing her as \"Madame Lindsay,\" and Lindsay admonishing her, \"Don\\'t call me madam!\") John Rountree is an upright business man who wants to work with the district attorney to eliminate the party girl influence on doing business; his son Jay (Fairbanks) is a ne\\'er-do-wheel frat boy in love with dad\\'s secretary, Ellen (Jeanette Loff)--a girl with a secret.<br /><br />Jay and his frat brothers crash the United Glass party, and a drunken Jay is trapped by a party girl, herself in a delicate situation.<br /><br />The usual confusion ensues.<br /><br />As the previous commenter notes, the sound quality is abysmal, but it may be just as well--the dialogue is no great shakes. There are certain scenes painful in their laughableness, especially the death scene of a tender young thing who\\'s fallen 6 stories, and yet appears not to have a scratch on her.<br /><br />It\\'s a dreadful film, and not even dreadful in that delicious \"so bad it\\'s good\" sort of way.',\n",
              " b'This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin\\' Gary is a small-town kid who is (assumed) well-liked for his many impersonations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for whom he is very passionate), Gary\\'s actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This results in him making various justifications for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast. In the second installment, Harris exploites the struggle between Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary. The third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for Harris\\' extreme sensitivity with the subject. Unlike the second installment, \"The Orkly Kid\" shows Gary as a truly troubled character. He struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast. The movie is depicted so realistically that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. Surely, one can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but may also identify with him as an outcast.',\n",

She has, unfortunately, been given no opportunities to show her considerable talent in film. While Cruel Intentions is a bad movie, Harvard Man is one of the worst - if not the worst - movie I have ever forced myself to sit through. The writing is practically non-existent. There are many scenes of back and forth dialogue with little purpose but to fill time. There are several simultaneous plots (gambling, drug addiction, sexual cheating, dealing with the mob), none of them interesting in their execution. There is no coherence - each plot thread seems forced in to fill time and is not interwoven with a big theme. One soon gets the feeling that the movie was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a hurry to meet a deadline. Harvard Man is transparently what it is: a quickly-made attempt to capitalize on Gellar's fame. To watch it is to wait for its end, amazed that such a thing actually made it as a major motion picture. I CAN'T believe the average rating here is close to 5. Anyone who says this movie is anything but awful is either mentally deficient or has an agenda. The only reason to watch this movie is to gawk at its atrociousness.\",\n",

Cynthia Sikes plays his lovely daughter who is clueless about her father's identity and history but she is memorable and she is better known for her role in St. Elsewhere. Sadly, I hated reading about Jack Cassidy's tragic death. Wherever you are Jack, we miss you still after 30 years. Columbo always catches his man or woman even in this episode. As Columbo always says, there is no such thing as a perfect murder. Just when you think he's got away with his crimes, nothing could be further from the truth. If you love Columbo, you will love this episode and how he catches his man is just as much fun to watch and learn.\",\n",

I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!). It has everything that successful Disney movies have with the smooth animation, decent storytelling and the occasional tug at your heart strings.

              " b'I saw this advertised on Netflix in the \"Gay and Lesbian\" section and the synopsis sounded cute, so I thought to myself that it wouldn\\'t hurt to give this movie a shot.<br /><br />Wrong. From the beginning of the movie, we have one of the most unique plot lines ever to be featured in a gay movie... a hot sad gay guy has just been dumped by his boyfriend and looks for love in all the wrong places, starting with the escort section in the back of a gay rag! How unique! Not to mention the escort who shows up happens to be a good looking Australian guy stuck in a financial rut (who has the strangest bones and muscles ever seen in a torso). Needless to say, the escort is only interested in business, but the hot sad gay guy falls for him and helps him out by giving him a high-profile job at his business firm! Then it gets even more original from here. The escort falls in love with his business partner and here begins a complicated gay love triangle.<br /><br />What is with this rut lately of gay films that continually explore the sad and lonely single lives of very attractive gay men who are financially successful and situated that pairs them up with a very attractive \"come from the wrong side of the tracks\" guy in relationships that go awry? The only difference with this movie is that it was poorly acted and heavily laden with a continual line of gay clich\\xc3\\xa9s that as a gay viewer myself, I was embarrassed just watching it! This movie was so amateurish, it could only be adored by a pretentious small-town gay and lesbian film festival wedged between various film shorts and a documentary on gay life in Anytown, America. What a load of garbage and a waste of my time! I couldn\\'t identify with anything or anyone in this so-called \"movie\".<br /><br />It was neither charming nor witty. The plot was trite, the characters were shallow, the story writing was lazy and the whole idea was predictable from the start. If very attractive gay men can\\'t seem to get it together in the real world, then I guess the average Joe such as myself doesn\\'t have a snowball\\'s chance in Hell either! <br /><br />Gay or straight, this movie was trash.

The entire time I watched the movie, I made fun of the acting, and was never once scared. The thing that made the most mad was that the cover of the movie jacket had nothing at all to do with the movie. Totally fooled me into spending $4 on this film. The longer I watched, the more convinced I became that this was someone's final project for film making 101.

There are not special effects. The budget is low. The direction and acting could be better but is still not bad. But the end result is good. Personally I think most people don't get this movie (and hence rate it lower than they should) is because the endings are not pat like most Hollywood shows.

If you have read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no altering of scenes or characters. This is a film made by King fans for King fans.<br /><br />For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it is a 'gypsy curse' horror, with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for, to become thinner. The final third has some severe structural problems, and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little.<br /><br />There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you might as well read the book, because there is nothing new here...<br /><br />\",\n",
              " b'In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Much to the dismay of Holly, a freak auto accident has recently killed his friend, according to those who knew Harry.<br /><br />But in searching for details of Lime\\'s death, Holly gets contradictory stories that don\\'t add up. One of the persons who knew Lime is an attractive woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) whose continued presence in the story invites suspicion. The film\\'s plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.<br /><br />The film\\'s story is okay. But what makes \"The Third Man\" really interesting is the B&W cinematography, by Robert Krasker. Unlike most films, camera movement here is restricted, so as to draw attention to each frame\\'s geometry. Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter. Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves. Further, very high-contrast lighting, especially in outdoor scenes at night, creates a bizarre, almost nightmarish look and feel, and are suggestive of German Expressionism.<br /><br />All of which results in a visual disorientation for viewers that parallels Holly\\'s disorientation both in the streets of Vienna and in his understanding of the circumstances surrounding Lime\\'s absence. In most outdoor scenes there\\'s a conspicuous lack of crowds, a lack of hubbub one would expect in a bustling city. Instead, only a few secondary characters appear in night scenes. This sparseness in characters on the streets conveys the impression that hidden eyes are watching Holly, ready to pounce at any moment from out of dark shadows.<br /><br />\"Everybody ought to (be) careful in a city like this\", says one character to Holly, as an implied threat. Soon, a man who wants to give Holly some valuable information is murdered.<br /><br />The script\\'s dialogue is quite impressive, with some interesting lines and points of view. Some of the dialogue is in German, which enhances authenticity.<br /><br />The film\\'s acting and editing are very, very good. Adding a slightly romantic, and at times melancholy, tone to this dark film is the music of the \"zither\", an instrument similar to a guitar, but sounding quite different.<br /><br />My one complaint about this film is that it\\'s hard to keep tabs on some of the background characters. Trying to connect names with faces can be difficult, resulting in some confusion.<br /><br />\"The Third Man\" tells an interestingly bleak story, set in a bleak, desolate urban environment, rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal B&W cinematography.',\n",

Maybe that would be interesting if the commentary itself had at least a spark of originality, alas... Person after person, every participant in this unwatchable boring mess says nothing but stereotypical b.s. It is almost as if the filmmakers made their product for someone from Mars - someone who has never seen or even heard of a prostitute in their entire life!<br /><br />Oh, there is also Denise Richards in this movie. Yes. We all know that Denise Richards adds credibility to any movie! Seriously though, Richards and Daryl Hannah are in this film, but why they are here is anyone's guess.

The day when someone decided to make a documentary about the word fu*k was inevitable one day if you really think about it, and here it is. If only the main contributions weren't from dumb Americans who haven't a clue the word is Anglo Saxon in origin and not an abbreviation (Fornicate Under Command of the King?!?) Although some interesting points are put across, such as the release one feels from using the word and it's traditional use with negativity and sexual encounters. Although most of the talking heads are speaking in defence of the word, a few conservatives put their point across and speak of defence of a society with standards and decency. It's short and is more than satisfactory as a documentary, but as it is even pointed out, c*nt is the word really likely to send shudders down the spine. Why wasn't a documentary made of that? Probably not commercial enough. ***\",\n",

I left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role, even though I knew that was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with CP. By no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings. Most highly recommended.\",\n",

Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day, nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked, so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. But on his way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. He doesn\\'t remember what happens and at the next ordinary day, his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings, are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character, is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out, how to become a normal human being again. By the way-his animal instincts, helps him in some situations. Schneider\\'s performance is a so-so. The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies, called mindless fun as I have written above. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in. He is a great comedian but this is not his best movie.',\n",

They are eloping and to steer clear of the \"authorities\", they take a back road that turns into an entrance to hell. Yeah, it\\'s corny but it\\'s very entertaining and very well done.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is very good and the production including scenery and music are top notch. I loved the fact that \"Hitler\" is played by Gilbert Gottfried! Anne Meara, Ben Stiller, and the lovable Richard Farnsworth are also in the film as well as the late Kevin Peter Hall. As always, Chad Lowe does an A+ performance as \"Charlie\". I loved \"Hell Cop\" too. This is a fun movie!

              " b'Hurray for Hollywood. The same (or at least same type) anti-war, pseudo intellectual morons who attempted to BRAND Vietnam veterans with the Hollywood lies. The same smears, from those who have never served their country, in an attempt to discredit the only heroes we have left, the American Serviceman.<br /><br />Facts exist, studies have been made, papers have been written, and the facts are in re those who served in Vietnam compared to study groups comprised of those who served in the military, but not in Vietnam and groups of \"civilians\" that found ways to avoid military service. The Vietnam vet is better adjusted, less mental illness, healthier, wealthier, more productive, and less likely to act like a total butt wipe than the latter groups. The information is available to those that care to know the facts rather than to follow the California nutcases. When studies are made re the veterans of the Middle East and/or Afghanistan, the result will probably be the same.<br /><br />The American fighting men and women are not dopers, drunks, sadistic baby killing, dog drowning, prisoner torturing retards. No doubt some few go over the line. However if anyone has a question about that, who has never served anything but their own self-interest. they have not earned the right to either ask the question and do not deserve an answer.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones as the grieving father (not an retired officer by the way.. he played a retired sergeant)is as always EXCELLENT... Susan Sarandon as always is not believable... and Charlize Theron is Terrific, as always.. Those playing the friends of Jones\\'s deceased son are typical smarmy Hollywood types, trying to look like soldiers but would probably be better cast in movies like Broke Back Mountain.. I was impressed with Francis Fisher\\'s parts.. no silicon there.<br /><br />Anyway the movies overall is pretty good, but then some halfwit has to come up with idea of the flying the US flag upside down to show what they think of this country...That ticked me off..<br /><br />You know these are the same people that live in 30,000 square foot houses with a garage full of gas guzzling cars, a few airplanes, and helicopters, tour buses, Olympic size pools, who think nothing of spending $1000 bucks for a meal they do not eat... and then campaign to get the poor smucks who make %50,000 or less a year to conserve, etc.<br /><br />The Hollywood morons... they are so out of touch with reality that it is disgusting....

              " b'Movies are only effective if they involve the viewer; we can\\'t enjoy someone\\'s story if we don\\'t care about what happens to them. In general, the best way to do this (at least for a mainstream movie) is to present a strong story. Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, \"Minority Report\" is a tense thriller that poses a number of intriguing ethical questions.<br /><br />Welcome to the era of PreCrime: a world without murder. Three special people, known as the PreCogs, are about to predict murders before they happen. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) works for the PreCrime division, and is passionate that it works. But when the PreCogs predict that he is going to commit a murder, Anderton has to find out why before he is caught.<br /><br />If you could see into the future, does that mean that what you saw is really going to happen? Can someone change their mind at the last minute? Is it right to arrest someone for a crime that they were going to commit, but hadn\\'t done it yet? These questions lie at the heart of \"Minority Report,\" and fortunately they are not mentioned then disregarded; the whole storyline revolves around answering them.<br /><br />Despite his bizarre off-screen antics, Tom Cruise is a good actor. This is certainly one of his best performances. Anderton is a man who uses this opportunity to battle personal demons, although it only partly works. He is deeply troubled by his past, and that conflict makes Anderton an almost tragic figure. Cruise plays the part perfectly, and we never stop rooting for him. Colin Farrell is effective in his breakout role as Danny Witwer, the agent from the Judicial System who begins snooping around PreCrime, perhaps to take over John\\'s job. Max von Sydow brings a deep note of class to the film as PreCrime\\'s director, and John\\'s mentor, Lamar Burgess. It\\'s an effective performance, and for a man who could easily play an elderly man, von Sydow is certainly an arresting figure. Samantha Morton has the most difficult part as Agatha, one of the PreCogs. She\\'s bizarre, acting as if she\\'s on some sort of a drug. But Morton allows us to peek beneath to see her lucidity. Kathryn Morris, the always wonderful Lois Smith, and Mike Binder are good in bit parts, while Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare steal scenes in terrifically loopy performances.<br /><br />This is Steven Spielberg\\'s best film since \"Saving Private Ryan.\" He keeps the pace up, and shows us that he\\'s still a director, and not just a name on a marquee. Spielberg has a vivid imagination and brings everything to life. This is a science fiction film, but it is grounded in reality enough that it is plausible that everything that happens in this film could be real in the near future. The film is well-paced and put together; it\\'s a complex plot, and deals with some serious ethical questions, but it\\'s never confusing. Special note goes to his music selection. Spielberg mixes some classical music into the film very effectively, and the soundtrack by John Williams represents some of his best work.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the film is that in one scene, it breaks the rules the film functions by for its own convenience. That being said, most people won\\'t notice (or care).<br /><br />Note: while the action sequences are pretty standard stuff (albeit well-shot and choreographed), the flashbacks of murders are pretty graphic. This really pushes the boundaries of PG-13.',\n",

Probably not. <br /><br />The main problem with little man is its concept- its far too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoonish comedy ), so when the loud , laboured and over the top jokes kick in , they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is.<br /><br />\"But its a comedy \" some of you might be screaming. Thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot.I mean come on , think about it if you saw a baby with A GROWN MANS FACE , wouldn\\'t you be the least bit suspicious?

Well heres the thing see, there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more. <br /><br />If you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot, stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs.What ever you do steer clear of little man.',\n",
              " b'Whenever I see most reviews it\\'s called \\'a misfire for Eddie Murphy\\'. These critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he\\'s doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect... \"The Golden Child\" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clich\\xc3\\xa9s, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I don\\'t understand the pervading lack of \\'love\\' for its efforts, at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; it\\'s unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. There\\'s nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.<br /><br />Yes it\\'s silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that \\'ridiculous\\' is where Hollywood\\'s idea of mysticism begins and ends. What\\'s more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.',\n",
              " b'A movie theater with a bad history of past gruesome murders reopens. Of course, the bloody killings start anew. Written, directed, shot, scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless Rick Sloane (who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious \"Hobgoblins\"), this horrendously ham-fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way: the excruciatingly lethargic pacing, the painfully static, grainy cinematography (there\\'s a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout), an annoyingly droning and redundant hum\\'n\\'shiver synthesizer score, the flat (non)direction, a tediously talky and uneventful script, the groan-inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, the bloodless murder set pieces, a pitifully unscary killer (he\\'s just some wrinkled-up old guy in pasty make-up), the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters, a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending, and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar. This crud totally lacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy vigor required to be enjoyable junk. Instead it\\'s just a bland, plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a so-shoddy-it\\'s-smoking sort of way. Only a smidgen of nudity and the delightful presence of the always dependable Mary Woronov as a snarky, sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall crumminess of this lousy loser.',\n",

The only half decent actress is the lead, Christina Campenella, the rest must have been hired from the unemployment line. The story seems to me an extremely low budget version of \"The Shining\" and takes place MOSTLY in a cheap motel room. A couple leave New York city to move in a half star motel room in Maine( for some reason, I just thought of the actors) so the guy ( Don Wood) can write his best selling novel, while his girlfriend works in a library. After they move in, strange things start happening. The feeble attempts to scare you are laughable, if not sad. Of course, the room number is 13, which must have required a great deal of thought for the writer to come up with something so original, and is haunted by a woman who had a relationship with a minister. This movie has a real crappy soundtrack that sounds like a propeller plane, which is really annoying! This film is true proof that they will put anything on DVD. The movie is written, produced and directed by the same guy, and believe me it shows. I can honestly say this is the worst movie, by far, I have ever seen. I have the movie on DVD, which in one way is a good thing, it\\'s a perfect cure for my insomnia. This film is truly a horror, it\\'s horrible!

The Maroc scenery was a visual treat. My father lived there in the early 60\\'s and still waxes poetic about the landscape and wonderful people he met there.<br /><br />The negativity that a few have expressed about Hidalgo puzzles me and smacks of ulterior motives. I went to the theater expecting to see a \"movie\" with a positive message. I came out of the \"movie\" with so much more. But then, anyone who gives it an ounce of thought, can understand that the phrase \"based on a true story\" is not the same as \"non-fiction\".

              " b\"I thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:<br /><br />First, when Shen told Wendy that he would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay.<br /><br />Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain or go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the eight out of nine suns). Because of his heroic contribution, he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but his wife, Chang-O stole it. After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a hare. She then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version). I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented.<br /><br />The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra-cotta Warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terra-cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is Chinese-American and doesn't have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.<br /><br />The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight... I mean, it's rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.<br /><br />All in all, all of or either of the producer, writer, or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. I would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, I would give it credit (2 stars) for removing one stereotype of Asians and Asian-Americans of being smart and quiet.\",\n",
              " b\"As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists.<br /><br />We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse.<br /><br />This movie is so bad I wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.\",\n",

John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from Hell, and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. And what the hell's Jack Warden doing in this mess? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity, the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience.

The original title was \"Johnny Zombie\" (thank God the producers had a change of heart!) I was in the theater scene. I rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters.

It's a bizarre mishmash of MGM kitsch, Red-baiting, and homosexual archness, adapted from the stage musical. It also must be the dullest movie ever made in celebration of fun. I don't know what the stage version did (it's never revived) but this movie has one idea (Communism boring, Capitalism fun!) and it keeps beating us on the head with it while showing us around out a lot of Louis Whatever hotel suites that few Americans in 1957 could afford either. 1...2...3...what are we fighting for! (Money, evidently.) The propaganda would be more persuasive if Charisse didn't look sexier in her Worker's Black Nylons than she does in the silks that mark her transformation from dull comrade to fun capitalist-- and if those silks didn't actually appear to be nylons. <br /><br />For Komic Relief, there are Three Komrades-- they're the Three Stooges. The 'Ninotchka' (Charisse) is innocent of kissing-- she's like the native girls in '30s South Seas flicks. I guess they didn't do THAT behind the Iron Curtain. Perhaps the relevant passages were blacked out of her state translation of THE SUN ALSO RISES. We wait, and wait, and wait while Astaire sings and Janis Paige (she's trying to be Jean Hagen) chews the scenery, for Astaire and Charisse to dance. The dance numbers are very good and show off Astaire's unending quest to try out new ideas. Shame the rest of the movie didn't do so. <br /><br />This period piece is useful as a stored version of the Broadway show but it's watchable only if you occasionally use fast-forward.\",\n",

Imagine my surprise to discover this IS a John Waters movie. Where to start? The blank-eyed performances? The screwed-up dualism? The awful editing and pacing? The banal innuendo? The heartless sexual politics? Maybe you need to be American and to have suffered the crazy US religious right to really get this movie - to the rest of us, it feels like someone crossing the street to pee on a Madonna statue...

              " b\"Jaws 3-D is a trashy second sequel to Jaws that's more likely to turn viewers' stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat. <br /><br />The premise sees biologists Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong capturing a great white shark to hold at Florida's Seaworld. However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies. Within hours, the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge. <br /><br />Dan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea. Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr. But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down. The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense. The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness. But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame. <br /><br />Fortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm.

              " b\"- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.\",\n",
              " b'This is the first of \"The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare\" BBC series I\\'ve seen, and if all of them are like this, I might watch no more. Being practically the full text of the play is everything this \"Romeo & Juliet\" has going for it, lacking in all other departments. Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director, both in the technical and artistic aspects. In the former, because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid. Take in consideration, for example, the badly edited first shot of Abraham and Balthasar in the opening scene, or the Nurse\\'s entering of Friar Lawrence\\'s cell, asking where\\'s Romeo with him being so very in front of her that she\\'d clearly see him even if she was blind. And, in the latter, because every single one of the performers is misdirected, even if some of them are good actors. Rebecca Saire looks exactly the way I\\'ve always imagined Juliet to look like, and she doesn\\'t seem to be a bad actress for a teenager, but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind. Patrick Ryecart as Romeo is even worse, being not only as dull as Juliet, but also way too old and not even good-looking, coming across as a combination of Malcolm McDowell and the Chucky doll. Putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other, let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written. Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader, which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended, no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings. This Tybalt is so mean-looking that we don\\'t believe the characters\\' pity after his demise. As for Paris, I kept thinking of \"Prince Valium\" from Spaceballs. Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.<br /><br />At 168 minutes, this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters, because the characters don\\'t empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles. The best screen version is still Franco Zeffirelli\\'s. But, to be fair, this BBC one isn\\'t nearly as bad as abominations like George Cukor\\'s flamboyant geriatric version, or the crime against Humanity that is Baz Luhrmann\\'s feature-length MTV video. 4/10.',\n",

              " b\"**SPOILERS** A bloody shootout in a Mafia safe-house apartment results in the rip off of $300,000.00 from the mob's Harlam bank. It also cost the lives of seven people including two members of the Mafia Gennaro family. <br /><br />Old Don Gennaro, Frank Macetta, is worried about his operations in Harlem falling apart and has his young hot-shot and sadistic son-in-law Nick D'Salvio, Tony Franciosa,to get things back to normal. Nick starts by trying to get back the stolen loot with the help of the Mafia controlled Doc Johnson, Richard Ward,who runs their Harlem rackets. <br /><br />The three, who knocked off the mob's monthly take, Jim Harris Joe Logart & Henry Jackson, Paul Benjamin Ed Bernard & Antonio Fargas,are marked for death not only by the Mafia and the Jackson Harlem syndicate but by the NYPD. Not just for ripping off the mob but for the murder of two policemen who tried to stop the trio's getaway.<br /><br />Put in charge of the murder/robbery investigation is young and collage educated Let. Poke, Yaphet Kotto, which irritates the local police precincts Capt. Mattelli, Anthony Quinn, who feels he should be the one in charge. This causes friction not only between the two cops but the men of the 27th precinct who feel that Capt. Mattelli should run the investigation.<br /><br />During the movie Capt. Mattelli grudgingly accepts the decision of Let. Poke being put in charge over him since he's been compromised by taking graft from Johnson for years, that will only hamper finding the three hoods who ripped the Johnson/Mafia off. Capt. Mattelli also learns only to late that once your in the pay of the mob the only way you can get out, or retire, of that squalid arraignment is in a pine box.<br /><br />Extremely brutal crime/drama with two of the persons, Henry J. Jackson & Joe Logart, who dared to take the mob's ill-gotten gains ending up viciously tortured and murdered by the maniacal Nick D'Salvio, who took a sick and morbid glee in doing the two in. <br /><br />The third man, and head, of the group of robbers Jim Harris was a lot harder and far more dangerous nut to crack and find by Nick and his hoods. Tracked down in an abandoned building in West Harlem. Jim alone with his common-law wife Gloria,Norma Donaldson, begins to freak-out when he get's epileptic seizures with no medication on hand to relive them. This time thing don't go off that well for Nick and both the Mafia and Johnson mob, like it did with both Joe & Henry. By the time the shootout was over the entire block, where Jim was holding out in, was left shot up and demolished together with Jim Nick and Gloria.<br /><br />Superior crime/movie with a stand-out performance by a young, 34 at the time, Yaphet Kotto as Let. Poke who showed the overly brutal Capt. Mattelli that you don't get the same results in solving crimes with 1940's police tactics in the year 1972. Even more important it's a lot better to be an honest cop then a dirty one in both having a clear conscience and long lifespan.\",\n",

I am married, with kids, a woman who had a career and gave it up for family and can still relate to the 'Mickey' character.

You then realize you are happy with what you have...you just have to remind yourself a couple times out of the day.

              " b\"After Zeppo Marx refused to move on with his brothers to MGM from Paramount, the Marxs usually secured the services of another player, usually a singer to function in Zeppo's nondescript place. Usually that person had a lot more personality than Zeppo did. It was Allan Jones in two films, Kenny Baker in one and in The Big Store it was Tony Martin.<br /><br />The still very much alive, but retired Tony Martin, had one of the great voices of the last century. He never made the screen impact that other singers did, though he was in some very good films. His main media outlets were records, radio, and as one of the premier nightclub attractions, especially when he appeared with his second wife Cyd Charisse. Martin had two songs to sing in The Big Store, the much maligned Tenement Symphony and a really nice ballad, If It's You.<br /><br />Martin is the heir to one half of Phelps Department store. The other half is owned by his aunt Margaret Dumont. The Hastings Brothers, who own a chain of department stores, are looking to buy this one. <br /><br />Manager Douglass Dumbrille has been doing a little embezzling on the side and he's afraid that if Martin sells his half, he's taking a stretch up the river. After Martin becomes the victim of an attempted murder, Dumont hires who else, detective Wolf J. Flywheel who is of course Groucho Marx. <br /><br />By a happy coincidence, Groucho has Harpo as a sidekick and Harpo's brother in the film Chico is a friend of Martin's. So now we have all the Marx Brothers working at the store.<br /><br />The Big Store is usually dismissed as one of the Marx Brothers lesser films, but it's always been a favorite of mine. Another reviewer said there were too many musical numbers. I don't think there were any more or less than in other films of their's. The running time is a bit short so it might seem like there's more.<br /><br />The highlight for me is always the final chase seen through the store, especially since Douglass Dumbrille joins in the fun. Dumbrille on screen usually plays some serious villains, probably his best known part is that of Mr. Cedar the lawyer who is milking the estate that Gary Cooper is inheriting in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. <br /><br />Dumbrille is just as successful dealing with the Marx Brothers over embezzlement as he is with Gary Cooper. But here this very serious and obviously classically trained actor joins right in the slapstick fun. Dumbrille looks like he's having a ball. Later on he would really cut loose in a couple of Abbott and Costello films.<br /><br />A question to all movie fans. Who do you think had the most inventive screen character names, W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx?\",\n",
              " b'There is nothing funny about Funny Games, or at least it wasn\\'t for what I saw. The movie is marketed as an \"important\" social commentary about violence in cinema, but I left the movie without any new information. INstead the movie is a gratuitous torture porn flick that is constantly relentless. The word \"relentless\" is usually associated with movies when giving a positive review. Do not confuse my choice of words as a recommendation of any kind. Relentless it is. Stupid and pointless it is also.<br /><br />The plot is obvious and almost arbitrary. A moderately new family is brutally tortured by two psychotic individuals. They wager a \"bet\" with the captives. The bet: The twisted minds believe they can kill this family before a certain time, while the family believes in survival. Of course, such bet could end with three gunshots at point blank range, but that would be too easy. Literally the largest chunk of the movie involves the family being tortured with random objects. As seen by advertisements, golf clubs are used frequently.<br /><br />Naomi Watts stars and produced this film. Why would she attach herself to such a project? Because while some people will criticize the film for being without any redeeming merits, others will praise the \"originality\" and the \"daring\" aspect involved in creating something so \"deep and meaningful\". I should probably say at this time that this film in question is a shot for shot remake of an 11 year old Austrian version directed by the same individual. So much for originality. So why remake something so soon? Because as we all know, Americans can\\'t enjoy a movie unless it is made domestically. Maybe we should make a commentary about that problem.<br /><br />There is currently a debate about art versus entertainment. It is being suggested that even though the film contains hardly (if any) entertainment value, it should be accepted because of its artistic quality. Call me naive, but I feel that art and entertainment should be mixed. And while some film snobs will suggest that the film is \"complicated\" and needs a high intellect to enjoy, I say that it is too simplistic and predictable. Within the first ten minutes I was very aware of what was to follow. I knew how the ending was going to turn out. The only thing I didn\\'t realize is the amount of manipulation that was to be used. At one point a remote control is used to rewind the action that just happened while the audience is scolded for rooting on the heroine in a violent act that they would have booed for if the villain was the one with an upperhand. The scene is then played out in a now grim way, leading to an ending that is so \"original\".<br /><br />The sad thing about all of this horrible movie is that it is being marketed like a fresh horror satire. Scream was a very good horror satire that accomplished what it set out to do, which was to show the audience how horror films were clich\\xc3\\xa9d, violent and unoriginal without actually producing a clich\\xc3\\xa9d and unoriginal horror film. Without such false advertising, I can\\'t see why anybody would want to watch Funny Games. It promises an explanation for the current audience\\'s fascination of torture porn, but yet resolves to become an exhausting and manipulative torture porn story.<br /><br />The psychopaths (played by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) constantly break the fourth wall in which they want to know what the audience is thinking. They assume that the audience is rooting for Anne, George and little Georgie. I didn\\'t. Forgive me for not caring for one of the dumbest families captured on film. Forgive me for wanting to walk out of this inspired 100 minute rant about violence in cinema. Forgive me for hating Funny Games. Forgive me for advising that you avoid this movie like a plague.<br /><br />Rating: zero stars out of ****',\n",

              " b'This film may have been the biggest let-down I\\'ve experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. Overall, I simply found this to be a second-rate movie.<br /><br />Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and Ma Wu handles his character with cheerful competence. On the other hand, Ma Wu\\'s makeup (facial hair) is so obviously phony that I simply could not take him seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween, complete with the $4.95 stick-on beard.<br /><br />The special effects were so-so, though the \"undead\" in the cellar were pretty good. The tree-tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick, though the POV shots from the tongue\\'s view more closely resembled Sam Raimi\\'s trademark shots in the more recent \"Evil Dead\" trilogy. The pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get. (In fact, it most closely reminded me of the \"Lost in Space\" episode where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and....) <br /><br />The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense and no plot twists. In fact, you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good, who is bad, and who is going to survive.<br /><br />I just returned this film to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review. The very first thing I did was check the production date. Yep, it says 1987...not the 1967 that I thought it might be. And that pretty much sums it up: The production values and FX are typical of the 1960s. The plot and action seem much older, as Hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s.<br /><br />** out of *****',\n",

              " b'Like many others, I was very interested in this remake of \"The Lathe of Heaven,\" for several reasons. The book by Ursula K. LeGuin is widely regarded as a science-fiction classic, although I have never thought it was among her best work. I read it after I saw the first \"Lathe of Heaven\" on PBS in 1980 and realized that considerable liberties had been taken with the story, although it was much closer to the book than this latest endeavor.<br /><br />Back then, \"Lathe\" was a bold experiment for PBS and the producers: To make an original full-length science-fiction TV movie on a limited budget that would appeal to an audience used to flashier entertainment. Remember, it was only three years since \"Star Wars\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" had revitalized screen science fiction, until then very much in the doldrums. The producers of LOH wanted to make a more intimate story than those blockbuster movies, one based more on human relationships. With their low budget, they looked for places and expedients that would transmit their vision. Although the story was set in Portland, Oregon, they filmed a lot of it in Dallas because of that city\\'s more futuristic architecture. I liked it very much and videotaped it, and have the tape to this day. (Unfortunately but inevitably, the tape had deteriorated significantly when I transferred it to DVD at the end of 2006. Never fear, it appears that it\\'s now available on commercial DVD.)<br /><br />It says a great deal about inflation in the movie business that the remake had a \"small\" budget of \"only\" $5 million. That would have been a lot of money for the original filmmakers. I also wonder why here in the States we had to wait until September of 2002 to see it when the first comments about it, from a viewer in Turkey, are from February!<br /><br />But whenever it aired, my reaction would be the same: Why did they bother to make it at all? There is so little of the original here that it is essentially a different work. They have taken the story and drained it of its blood. And what does happen goes beyond problems with temporal discontinuities and paradoxes; these people behave without logic or motivation. It looks like a long episode of the \"new\" Outer Limits or a similar show, one of those low-budget syndicated series that they film in Canada because it\\'s cheaper there, where there is money only for a few sets, a couple of computer graphics, and a lot of talk in closeup (to hide the spareness of the sets). All of the acting and dialogue takes place in murmurs. I usually like James Caan, but it looks like he\\'s been watching Bruce Willis\\'s recent film work and decided to try the minimalist, non-acting approach.<br /><br />Now that I\\'ve brought up The Outer Limits, remember how the opening credits used to talk about \"awe and mystery\"? Well, if you want awe and mystery, forget about this remake and go back to the 1980 version; it had much more of those qualities.',\n",

              " b'Larry Fessenden\\'s \"The Last Winter\" is a ambitious and smartly made film. It\\'s photographed beautifully and (by and large) acted with conviction and sensitivity. Though the central conceit about nature \"taking revenge\" is pretty corny, the atmosphere is also pretty compellingly bleak, and the tension mounts pretty effectively as things go from bad to worse. Sadly, as many other reviewers note, the ending throws it all away in a fit of awful CG monsters.<br /><br />However, try turning it off right at one hour 27 minutes and 30 seconds. This would have been a solid albeit ambiguous ending; if you must watch further do it on a second viewing and consider it a deleted ending. It\\'s just goofy and pointless, and the final \"twist\" at the end is telegraphed almost from the very beginning (in fact, one character early on describes aloud exactly what the twist will end up being).<br /><br />Even without the ending, the script has problems with its petty black-and-white portrayal of heroic environmentalist and selfish oil guy. An ensemble atmosphere pic like this lives and dies on the believability of its characters; Perlman\\'s Ed Pollock is simply too villainous to really be convincing, despite a few nice touches of humanity which Perlman brings to him. Le Gros\\' Hoffman is also a pretty unengaging hero, a blandly heroic saint of a guy who\\'s always right about everything. I\\'m a serious environmentalist and a left-leaning guy, but the film\\'s literal take on the situation (the dire warnings of natural disaster, the clear heroes and villains) is shallow at best and preachy and patronizing at the worst. It plays to the most obnoxiously self-congratulatory nature of people concerned with the issues presented here, while at the same time offering nothing of any real substance.<br /><br />Still, the film itself is a pretty fun watch, and a definite step up from Fessenden\\'s previous effort, the ambitious but amateurish \"Wendigo\" (the titular spirit of which gets name-checked here too!). Great photography combined with naturalistic acting from the likes of Kevin Corrigan and Zach Gilford do much to sell the vibe of the thing, and the setting and slow escalation of the action also add to the experience. Regardless of its stumbles, the film has loads of ambition to do something substantial and enduring, so even when it can\\'t quite deliver on its promise it still beats the slew of cheap-scare horror remakes which every year become more numerous.',\n",
              " b'The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it...or me. It is not a good movie. Terrible in fact. But terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. It would have made a great MST3K subject!<br /><br />Most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contrived plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You\\'ll thrill to slo-mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off, but WHO\\'S SHOT? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one finally goes down. You\\'ll sing along (in latin of course) with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death\\'s-choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical.<br /><br />So if you believe like I do that as movies get worse they get better, then this might be a decent choice for you. It\\'s not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, \"They Live\" featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it\\'s more fun to watch than luke-warm movies like Omen II or III.<br /><br />I give it 4 out of 10.',\n",

I also think it was the best story out of all ten stories, which is called \"HONEY GETTER\". The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting.

After hundreds of conversations and interaction in virtually every facet of daily life with Panamanians, I've yet to encounter a hint of regret for the U.S. invasion. The truth is that Panama labored under a dictator whose thirst for power and disregard for political dissent grew to an unacceptably dangerous point.<br /><br />But even if your politics won't permit you to agree with my comments above, you would acquit yourself well to ask why the U.S. honored the Panama Canal Treaties and handed over full control of the Canal in 1999. The central premise of The Panama Deception is that the U.S. sought to destroy the Panama Defense Forces in order to thwart handover of the Canal to Panama in accordance with the treaties signed by President Carter in the late 1970s. And yet, the U.S. closed its military bases, and today Panama is one of the most robust democracies in the Western Hemisphere and operates the Canal in sovereign fashion.\",\n",

It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.<br /><br />Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. And all of that doesn\\'t even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) <br /><br />Ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable \"twist\") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another \"twist.\" It\\'s all totally mechanical, right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about.)',\n",

Karachi was a modern city by every means in recent past but today go anywhere in this city, it may be a posh area, middle class locality or a slums you will find bearded men and burqa clad women in such a huge numbers that no one could even imagine some years earlier. This huge number of black bearded mullah and black burqa clad women on streets looks to me a black storm which is coming to destroy every thing. Time has come to make a film on this situation, I would like to suggest name of this film '' LAWA''. I think no one but Subiha can produce that kind of a film. I wish you best of luck Subiha.

Two, it is one of only about a dozen filmed appearances of big band great Jimmmy Dorsey, who performs, with his band, a number called John Silver (\"15 men on a dead man\\'s chest\") which I haven\\'t found elsewhere, and a few other songs. Three, the \"Pokomoko\" routine (\"Slowwwwly I turned, step by step I crept upon him . . .\") is done to perfection by A&C with Murray Leonard as the Derelict, which I\\'ve always remembered as one of my favorite A&C routines since I was ten years old. Furthermore, there\\'s a real live giant (Lock Martin), full costumes and exotic sets as you would expect from MGM, a magic skit by A&C, hypnotism, a fine performance from Douglas Dumbrille as the bad guy, and more good music. I would rate it below Abott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, In The Navy, In Society, The Naughty Nineties, and perhaps 3 or 4 others, but definitely in their top ten or twelve. But since it\\'s not in the Universal set, it\\'s not available on DVD anywhere.',\n",

It actually has a good cast featuring Jill Schoelen, Brad Pitt, Roddy McDowell and Donovan Leitch.

Upon return to School, his old friend Dwight (Pitt) decides he would rather humiliate him than to be his friend again. Jill Schoelen plays Paula who is Dwights girlfriend and is the love interest of Brian, also. Suddenly, teachers and students are turning up missing or dead and it comes down to whether Brian is the killer or Dwight is the killer.<br /><br />I saw this film many years ago and had trouble sitting through it then. I don't know why things would be different now. The script is laughable and the actors try to do their best but still turns out bad. What Roddy McDowell is doing in this movie playing a perverted principal is beyond me. Such a great actor and to end up in trash like this is just sad. The actor that does the best with his character is Brad Pitt. He does a surprisingly decent job. The murder scenes are extremely weak with a few off screen killings and one killing with a very fake ax to the head. Just disappointing... 3/10\",\n",

              " b\"First of all, I must say that I am no anime expert. My entire knowledge of the genre is limited to the more famous Miyazaki films, 'Ghost in the Shell' and its sequel, and now the beautiful, dark, tragic 'Elfen Lied'.<br /><br />The story centers around Lucy, a girl born with a genetic mutation which gave her horns and 'vectors' - powerful telekenetically controlled arms. The first time we meet her, she is cold-bloodedly killing soldiers and office workers in what appears to be a strange research facility. A sniper succeeds in shooting her in the head, ending her rampage. However, he fails to kill her: she falls into the sea surrounding the facility, and is later found washed up on the beach by two cousins. However, this is not the Lucy we saw spilling so much blood - the shot left her with severe amnesia, turning her into the innocent, childlike Nyuu. When an assassin and later another being of her kind are sent to destroy her, we witness the murderous Lucy emerging once more, only to transform back into Nyuu once the violence is over. As the series progresses, we gradually learn about Lucy's horrific past, finally leaving us with the dilemma: Were her brutal actions perhaps in any way justified? <br /><br />Elfen Lied is dark, that I will not deny. Lovers of light, happy entertainment will be disappointed and very likely offended. The series deals with all the darker aspects of humanity: the practice of alienating those who are different, murder, cruel experimentation, sexual abuse, sadism, torture, and even genocide or 'purifying the earth'. As the story progresses, we find that virtually all the main characters have experienced one or more of these, and much of the series focuses on their attempts to somehow cope with the trauma; to pick up the pieces.<br /><br />Which brings me on to the violence. Elfen Lied is decidedly not a series for the faint-hearted. We watch bodies being torn in half, children being dismembered, and one scene of horrific animal cruelty. However, throughout the series, I do not remember one act of violence that seemed in any way 'trashy' or unnecessary. This is no gore-fest made to entertain teenage males. What is often even more disturbing than the violence itself, are the emotions attached to it. Also, some of the most violent scenes are rather surreal: think characters being tortured to eerily beautiful Gregorian chants.<br /><br />The major characters of Elfen Lied are highly memorable: sinning and sinned-against Lucy and her touchingly loving alter ego Nyuu; endearingly awkward Kohta who continuously battles his feelings for her but has painful repressed memories; his cousin Yuka who many reviewers have branded as 'irritating' but is really a somewhat unsettling reflection of the jealousy that turned Lucy into a killer; lovable Nana who is basically Lucy without the violent side; and Mayu, the abuse victim whose story of recovery is one of the most uplifting in the series. I would also like to mention Mariko, a minor character but still my personal favourite: she is a young girl who has the same mutation as Lucy, who does horrific things to people with the air of a child burning ants with a magnifying glass.<br /><br />In conclusion, Elfen Lied is a mature and deep series which can be enjoyed on so many levels: from an action horror story to a philosophical debate on what it means to be human. The execution is exquisite, with images that linger in the mind for a long time. All in all, I recommend Elfen Lied to anyone with an open mind, a strong stomach, and a willingness to try something different.\",\n",
              " b\"DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART (Bin Lim Mai Ching)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Betrayed and left for dead by a gangster's duplicitous moll (Gigi Lai), a hired assassin (Daniel Wu) undergoes plastic surgery to remove the facial deformity which has marginalized him throughout his life, then returns to Hong Kong to take revenge against Lai and her associates.<br /><br />Amateurish exploitation thriller, plotted to labyrinthine excess by an uncredited scriptwriter, and directed with a breathtaking lack of conviction by sleaze specialist Billy Chung (notorious for a string of gruesome shockers, most notably the Anthony Wong vehicle LOVE TO KILL, made in 1993). Sex and violence appear to be the principal focus of Chung's attentions in DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART, but while the sex angle is exploited for all it's worth - Lai lounges around in revealing designer outfits whilst never quite managing to get completely naked - the film's violence appears to have been curtailed in post-production for a less restrictive censor rating. Wu struggles gamely under Chung's ham-fisted direction, playing the role of vengeful loner with his usual quiet dignity (cameraman Ally Wong spends as much time leering over Wu's beauty as Lai, which evens things up a little), while co-star Stephen Fung lurks around the periphery as an obsessed cop determined to uncover Wu's true identity and establish his connection (if any) to the murder of Fung's partner (Sam Lee, in a cameo appearance). Experienced character actor Lam Suet (ONE NITE IN MONGKOK) is Wu's loyal brother, David Lee plays Lai's lowlife gangster rival, and Convoy Chan is the boyfriend whom Lai throws to the wolves with sadistic glee.<br /><br />There's a juicy melodrama struggling to emerge from this artless enterprise, but the film plays like a cheap imitation of a HK crime thriller, lacking the sincerity and craftsmanship which has distinguished the former colony's cinematic output for decades. Clearly intended for a quick theatrical play-off before heading straight to video, DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART wastes a terrific premise and top-notch cast. Still watchable, if only for the pairing of Wu and Fung, but they deserve miles better than this throwaway effort. Dreadful, interminable music score by Tommy Wai.<br /><br />(Cantonese and Mandarin dialogue)\",\n",
              " b\"I've seen the film AND read the play, which I think makes me unique. It also makes me queasy. The word `queasy' is not a staple of my vocabulary, for some reason, but it leapt readily to mind as a precise description of how this miserable, grotty-looking, dull, funny-as-chloroform movie made me feel, and will make you feel, too, if you're not careful. The play was little more than a foray into a now extinct breed of artiness. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that it has never been produced anywhere in the world since 1970 - and hopefully, the sun will grow cold before it is produced anywhere ever again. The film is a botched version of the play, AND a foray into extinct artiness in its own right. Moreover I think something was wrong with the film stock. The very colours upset my stomach.<br /><br />Here is what remains of the plot synopsis, excluding that which has been so wittily summed up by the title: a widow has had her dead husband stuffed; she lugs his preserved corpse around wherever she travels; she has an idiot son who is sort of undergoing a sexual awakening (DON'T expect anything salacious); and that's about it. Every so often the dead father will appear in a little bubble in the top right-hand corner of the screen and comment on what, if anything, is going on. Sometimes he'll talk to his son. Sometimes he'll address the audience, with lines like, `Not much will happen in the next few minutes.' If he'd been honest, he would have added, `And not much will happen after that, either, so if you're thinking of walking out, cut your losses and do so NOW.'<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - the 1960s was the tail end of Hollywood's golden age, producing delightful throw-backs like **** and stunning new masterpieces like ****. (I'm sorry - I simply couldn't bear to see the names of two of my favourite films associated in any way with this one.) But it was also the Decade of Floundering. If you want to see just how badly Hollywood was floundering in the 'sixties, by all means watch this movie - but you'll probably decide that you didn't really want to know, after all.\",\n",

It should have read 'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego'.<br /><br />It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?' moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like.

A rather good cast doing nothing more than going out to the abandoned town and getting themselves kidnapped by the evil cult led by Ernest Borgainine in a rather good over the top performance. You know a movie is in trouble when it seems they are rushing things so no startling revelations here, only lets rush to the cool ending. Which is the highlight of the film, a rain that comes down and washes the cult members away, rather good effects, especially for the time, but this does not make up for the rest of the film. Which leads to a question I have, why are movies about Satan and his cults usually so bloody boring or bad for the most part? You would think these movies would be some of the most gory and scary the horror genre had to offer, but usually it falls flat. Still if you do watch the movie look out for the many stars who apparently had nothing else better to do.',\n",

Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I didn\\'t. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a film like \"Raising Victor\" over this one any day. I just was not too impressed.',\n",
              " b'I was four years old in 1977 and I saw \"Star Wars\" in the theater. Let me be very clear: I\\'m a huge SW fan, but that doesn\\'t mean that I see the prequel trilogy as a great experience in movie-making. I do, however, believe that \"Clone Wars\" is simply excellent. The animation style, the pacing, the story. It\\'s all there.<br /><br />My jaw dropped when Anakin and Ventress fought on Yavin IV for the very simple fact that they were fighting in a thunderstorm. No one has ever visualized the simplicity of a lightsaber battle where raindrops are hitting the blades and sizzling as soon as they make contact. That one idea shows to me that the animators are looking for something beyond the typical SW experience, and they found it.<br /><br />Yes, you do have to get used to the visuals, as they do look like \"Samurai Jack\" (but, being a \"Samurai Jack\" fan, I think that\\'s a good thing). And, if you watched them as they originally aired, you had to watch them in five minute increments for Volume One and 20 minute increments for Volume Two, which could throw you off in terms of the pacing (though, again, I thought they did it very, very well and that the way the chapters aired made perfect sense).<br /><br />In the end, there is a 120+ minute SW movie (basically Episode II and 1/2) between the two volumes of the DVDs. It shows Anakin and Padme\\'s romance in ways that Lucas couldn\\'t get across, it allows us to see Anakin become a Jedi Knight, and it gives some great insight into not only the prequel trilogy but also the classic one.<br /><br />If you even have the slightest interest in SW, these two DVDs are time and money well spent.',\n",
              " b'Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe \"How to lose friends & alienate people\". The underlying romance in the plot is, for the most part, displaced by a far more interesting \"rags to riches\" tale. Although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed, in several screen shots, it does have a sense of; getting the \"nitty gritty\" out of the way, focusing on those key relationships which make \"office politics\" and using those almost irrelevant scenes, used purely for comic effect. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately very clever, playing well on the trans-Atlantic relationship Pegg shares with his co-stars and merging the cross between the high and low -life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey. The different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film. Both the \"trading places\" relationship between Pegg and Huston and the \"love, hate\" relationship between Pegg and Dunst do work so well in a story that is, for want of a better word, charming. Even Fox, whose main asset is of course sex appeal, shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that \"bimbo\" role all to well. Its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work. From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy.',\n",

A good cast of quality B actors, the thighs of Jessica Simpson and... that is about it!<br /><br />I believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea. Basically, lets do a kind of Legally Blond film, but do it in New York. That big bright city of chances, power and money and where everyone is a heartless, power/money hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, small town bimbo, that brother of Owen Wilson and for some no apparent reason Andy Dick (only because of him you should ignore this film).<br /><br />Basic story line:<br /><br />Boy leaves girl for NY, girl follows, boy cheats, girl stays in NY with cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks up, is courted by other boy (Brother Wilson) and together save the day and kiss.<br /><br />a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film, i.e. dire, awful, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic<br /><br />Just don't watch this film, you will be happier. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and i definitely agree with him. This film induces shock. And I know what you are thinking... at least at some point will I see Simpson naked or close too. It's not gonna happen, spare yourself the time and YouTube her. You will have better sexy time!<br /><br />The films editing is flimsy, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens?<br /><br />In conclusion; this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximum<br /><br />Another question why does Willie Nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson flick and why are there no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie?\",\n",

Then I see signs for Maine, Arostook County, etc. etc. and I\\'m like, apparently the directors think a Maine accent and a Southern accent are one and the same. It\\'s an insult to the great state of Maine. Also, the one girl says she\\'s going to Boston College and will be moving to Newton, which she describes as \"south of Boston.\" No, it\\'s not. Newton is west of Boston. So, apparently the folks who did this movie have no concept for geography. As for the movie itself, it\\'s like \"Lake Placid\" except not nearly as good. The Betty White role of the weird old lady is taken over by Cloris Leachman, who is not nearly as hilarious. The crocodile stomp-a-thon was entertaining, but there wasn\\'t enough of it.

Why didn\\'t the guy know about bullet proof vests? Why did Dora (Russell) have to say \"They raped me\"?<br /><br />It is terrible.

Whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant. As for special effects the film has none. The whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are \"stabbed\" (if you can even call it that) their reactions are totally unreal. The guns are more quiet than a mute. How this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind. Well thats about it. This review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch. If anyone is considering watching it or buying it I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons. I have said that it includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway. I suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film.',\n",
              " b'On rare occasions, a movie appears that successfully mixes elements of comedy with those of horror without being silly, cheesy or vulgar. Alex De la Iglesia\\'s superb \"El D\\xc3\\xada de la Bestia\" is definitely one of those movies.<br /><br />With an interesting plot, very likable characters, good SFX(considering the low budget) and a great cast, this formidable movie from Spain turns instantly in a cult classic by it\\'s own merits.<br /><br />Alex Angulo stars as father Angel, a priest who is also a scholar of theology, and that has discovered that John\\'s revelation contains encoded the date and place for the birth of the Antichrist: Christmas Eve of 1995 in Madrid. With that knowledge, he decides to turn himself into a satanist in order to discover the exact place of the birth. With the aid of metal-head Jose Maria(played by Santiago Segura) and the fake psychic Professor Cavas(played superbly by Armando De Razza), he goes on his quest to kill the baby before the anti-Christ\\'s reign begins.<br /><br />The story is filled with very dark humor as the priest has to sin in order for him to be convincing enough as a satanist. Alex Angulo really carries the film and gives a great performance, but is Armando De Razza who steals the show; Cavas and his girlfriend(played by beautiful Maria Grazia Cucinotta) have a great scene and Maria shines on her small role as the dumb blonde who dates Cavas.<br /><br />De la Iglesia takes us on the roller-coaster that is this movie, as it never drags and goes on with a fast-paced rhythm. A great camera-work makes the film even better and the bizarre beauty of it\\'s photography, contrasting the colorful Christmas with the dark gritty violence of the streets of Madrid.<br /><br />Overall a near-perfect film, \"El D\\xc3\\xada de la Bestia\" will keep you entertained with it\\'s irreverent(some would say blasphemous) dark humor.<br /><br />10/10. Very recommended.',\n",

The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun. You get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. However, that is also a weak point. The swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attach\\xc3\\xa9s his webs to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story.

              " b\"I saw this film years ago - so am a bit rusty - but since I'm reading their book at the moment I feel compelled to write: The thing that I remember most about it is this: The main characters are two despicable types so you don't care for them - I found my self not caring what happened because there was nothing about the characters to like or admire or empathise with. This totally undid any weight or consequence or plot the film had for me.<br /><br />Looking at their book they knocked up a first draft in a month or so and were shooting I think two months after that. They should have got feedback/reviews and done subsequent drafts and sorted that problem out first IMHO before shooting. It's was no surprise then to me that Mirimax and others wouldn't distribute it, and the offers they got were so small.<br /><br />I guess I'm not saying a film like this is wrong - just that it has extremely low appeal. That said though - I admire their independent spirit and go get it attitude - and wish them well!\",\n",
              " b\"This is by far not the best film I've ever seen, but it is probably the most important film I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time when it came out in 69, when I was 16. Before then, I was only marginally interested in films. Something to while away the time. And then I saw Satyricon. And life has never been the same ever since. All of a sudden I realised that film was more than simply recording images, all of a sudden it dawned on me that cinema could be art. Now, maybe Satyricon isn't great art, but to me at that time it was overwhelming. I'm sure other films have had this same catalytic effect on other people. Satyricon got me hooked on film, and I never looked back. I saw the film again about 10 years ago. I was amazed how it was still capable of exiting me. In spite of its wooden acting, its cardboard backgrounds, the unsynchronized lip movements this is amazing movie magic.\",\n",
              " b\"I never read or watched the original Astro Boy but I hope its better than this astrological unlikeable and generic CGI movie. Overall, the movie felt forced: so much happens in this hour and a half movie that there is no time to develop anything or even the hundreds of moral themes the movie throws at the audience (law of robotics, being human, finding where you belong).<br /><br />Oddly enough, the movie has a weird good guy/bad guy bipolar disorder where characters turn from being a good guy to a bad guy back to a good guy in a matter of minutes. Case in point: the second act builds heavily on Ham Egg being portrayed as a replacement fatherly figure and an all around good guy but all of a sudden, he turns on Astro Boy with no justification since his introduction. <br /><br />Animation wise, I thought the movie had no real distinct style and it felt like I was watching Robots but I found it odd that character design of Astro Boy looked completely different from all the other characters. He still had the anime look with big eyes yet the other characters looked like generic cgi characters. <br /><br />It's a shame because I wanted this movie to be better. In the end, Astro Boy is completely forgettable.\",\n",
              " b\"First of all, I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american. Sure, there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly, like at the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they aren't naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this, for example.<br /><br />But returning to the film itself, what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it. We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.<br /><br />All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th. Thus, what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks, and this may make some people infuriated; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies, regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.<br /><br />Finally, I think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened, and this movie could give some clues to them. This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future, and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today.\",\n",

When he wants to eat an empty can the Road Runner, or Hot-Roddicus Supersonicus, runs by. Of course the Coyote prefers a Road Runner over an empty can, so the chase can start once again. This time he uses a steel wall that has to pop up, a motorcycle, birdseed on a bridge, vitamins for the muscles in the legs and a Burmese tiger trap.<br /><br />Most of the gags work very good. The one on the bridge with the birdseed is terrific, the timing and use of the pop-up steel wall is perfect and the gag that involves the Burmese tiger trap, and the freeze frame directly after that (you will recognize the moment) are hilarious. A very good cartoon.',\n",
              " b'Mifune is in my top five movies. I have probably watched this movie over three hundred times, and every time I am delighted by a small detail: the camera angle, the dialog, the consistency, the absolutely beautiful setting. The script/story is full of a vibrancy and living in a such a simple and classy way that you can\\'t help but smile and believe in the immortality of these characters throughout human time, to be played out over and over again. And thus revealing the truth of the matter of love. Iben Hjejle, who plays Liva, is gorgeous and natural, an amazing amazing actress. She shines like the sun because she is allowed to. You can see she was allowed to \"play\" this character as she felt, and with heart. Anders Berthelsen, who plays Kresten, really absorbs the character, becoming this man who has survived the farm and made it to the top of monetary success, but finds love in the land and in Liva, as well as his brother Rud. Rud, played by Jesper Asholt, has to be the secret genius of this film. Every moment of every shot he is the gentle loving giant child. One actor who is going to be a huge success is Emil Tarding, who plays Liva\\'s little brother Bjarke. What a smart clever funny young man. They all shine because of the writing, first and foremost, and because of the Dogma rules, second. Dogma is a revolution, pure, true, allowing movement and flow, like a mountain river in comparison to a polluted ditch, making it hard to watch our American 100 million dollar movies with any respect. Mifune is personal. It is obvious there was a small crew. One gaffer for example, so that it\\'s as if you are there, the only one, inside the story, watching like a fly on the wall, enjoying the struggle through the confusion of life, as everyone. A massive crew of hundreds disturbs the acting, disturbs the vibe, becomes the movie, rather then the film being the focus. Somehow these larger and larger films just become money vampires for people to fill their bank accounts, rather then go to make something beautiful, as this. Anyway, one can see in watching this film how a movie should really \"feel.\" You can understand that the actors felt comfortable and the whole thing came very naturally for them, rather then forced. One can immediately understand that the director Soren K. Jacobson was excited and felt the artist, allowing himself the opportunity to touch base with why we make films in the first place, art. When I get sick of Hollywood films (every other day) I watch Mifune and feel refreshed and I believe in the poetry of film once again. I can believe that a simple story is capable of being entertainment and moving, rather then great big complicated stories that consume the characters, and miss the mark.',\n",

On the contrary, they are mutually exclusive except in rare cases - \"Home, Sweet Homicide\" is an exception which comes to mind. For the most part the components of the one nullify those of the other.<br /><br />Second, what were the qualifications for a screenwriter in the 30\\'s? This picture had some of the lamest dialogue and contained so many non-sequiturs that much of the plot was unintentionally funny and many gag lines fell completely flat. On the whole it made little sense and was a chore to watch.<br /><br />Saving grace here was the surprisingly able cast and better-than average screen credits which signified a superior production - but which was wrecked by and uninteresting final product.

I\\'m not sure what to make of it, actually. 5 minutes into it, I knew it was going to be bad (or \"bad\") in a good way, and was resentful that I was gonna have to sit through the entire thing to let the Gnosis sink in. But by the end, I was glad I had. This flick is truly creepy, without (I think?) intending to be creepy (or as creepy as it actually wound up being, since the movie DID bill itself as a \"grim fairy tale\"). Some very surreal elements (perhaps \"unlikely\" or \"poorly scripted\" masquerading as \"surreal\"): ex.: the bikers carrying their dead companion, funeral-procession-like, into a house they\\'ve never been in. Other creepy elements: corpses being made to blow out birthday cake candles for a young girl (as if anyone would want a cake with corpse-breath all over it) and, shortly thereafter, the same corpse inadvertently cutting off its own finger while slicing the cake. Some of the \"reanimation\" scenes are truly amazing and freaky: bodies rising from the ground at the oddest angles, seemingly defying the law of gravity (part of the mime\\'s craft in the film: kudos) with arms and legs askew- quite amazing to watch. I\\'ll cut this short, but I was very glad I was able to accidentally catch this movie last night, and I would definitely recommend it to fans of oddball cinema, mimes, zombies, puppets, or William Castle. PS- the peculiar ending of the movie (suggested by the beginning) made me like it even more. And I would normally have given this movie an 8 on its own merits, but for being so absurdly original, I gave it an extra point. Ta.',\n",

Jane Ryall who played Celia only did this one film. She was very nude throughout. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places.

Those who have seen this show know what I mean. The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was.

The scale of this self-directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished. There are, clearly, differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions, with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trial\\xc2\\x97at the time, trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese!<br /><br />Nonetheless, Chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible, so non-Cantonese audiences don't miss much. It's not, after all, the dialogue that makes a Chan flick, but the action and the painful out-takes. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun), and assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is superb from beginning to end, and there's not much time to breathe in between. It'll never get you thinking, but what an entertaining, and well strung-together, film. Arguably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there.\",\n",

This film is a true story that shows only a few of his vast adventures, which change his life. He gave up his home, family, love, comforts, and all that was familiar for almost three years to help people he had never met.

The acting was appalling and the story line was mediocre.<br /><br />A story of a man who was taken from his family as a baby and turned into to a human telepathic machine where he can move anything with his mind. He escapes and finds his sister and they run form the army and a select few special ops officers.<br /><br />Only watch if you like bad acting.<br /><br />I mean that!!<br /><br />My rating - 3/10\",\n",
              " b\"This superb compilation, appropriately narrated by another American cultural giant, Orson Welles, features the best of the 1940s Looney Tunes output, not just Bugs, but Sylvester, Tweetie, Daffy, Porky and Foghorn: 'What's Cookin' Doc', 'A Wild Hare', 'A Corny Concerto', 'Rhapsody Rabbit', 'I Saw A Putty Tat', 'Walky Talky Hawky', 'My Favorite Duck', 'Hair Raising Hare' and ''Old Grey Hare' (see my individual reviews).<br /><br />As a piece of cultural history, this semi-documentary is inadequate - there is no attempt to explain the subversiveness of these irreverent, flippant, violent, beautiful cartoons in the context of Disney-dominating ick-animation and gloomy, propaganda-laden World War Two - to which many of these cartoons tacitly refer, revealing complicated truths other 'real' films couldn't dare, such as the barbaric effect fighting barbarians can have on 'our' side; there is no analysis of the glorious pretention-pricking of both Hollywood and high culture, or Bugs' androgynous proteanism, or how the cartoons retained a level of fresh invention while seemingly locked in repetitive formulae; of the powerful psychoanalytic premisses of each short, in which a wild, elusive, lawless animal stands in for our stifled desires, especially as World War Two gives on to the post-war world of Joe McCarthy and chums.<br /><br />Rather, the in-between nostalgic bits celebrate harmless anecdote and japery, putting animation on its proper, neutered level. The cartoons themselves triumphantly bely such a project.\",\n",
              " b\"...this thing would be well-nigh unwatchable. Honest to Isis, 95% of this movie is just as bad as you've heard. The plot makes virtually zero sense and half of it (the Shield) is both scientifically impossible AND utterly unnecessary. There are broad, hammy performances, jarring leaps, and inconsistencies by the carload. And has anyone got any idea how/why the Zeistians ever evolved their bizarre immortality code? If I ever make a list of the ten most jaw-droppingly stupid movies, this will definitely be there. BUT....<br /><br />I give it a three [and not a two or below] solely for the charm and humor of Sean Connery's performance as Ramirez. Unlike others who, having apparently decided to play their roles here for laughs, went totally overboard into eye-rolling panic or guffawing villainy --Connery plays every one of his scenes in this strange new century with delightful lightness and panache. Whether gracefully bowing out of a stage performance of HAMLET, paying off a snooty men's tailor with his pearl earring, experiencing his first airplane ride (a wonderful sequence!) or giving his life to save MacLeod & girl from a Nameless Evil Machine, Connery is the definition of the gallant cavalier, and saves what otherwise would be an unsavable film. I salute him.<br /><br />Watch it for him if you think you can stand the rest of it....\",\n",
              " b'I wasn\\'t sure what to expect with this movie since the \"Loch Ness\" subject matter is kind of an overused topic. The fact that people said it was \"family friendly\" was also a strong turn-off: kiddie characters, themes ... \\'nuf said.<br /><br />However, I\\'m glad I saw this movie! It had a good, interesting story and great characters. The special effects were pretty good too. Even though the lead character is a young kid, it was OK since all of the characters and story were realistic and serious - and not depicted from a kid\\'s point of view.<br /><br />The story is framed around a modern-day pub where an old-timer is telling a couple young hikers/travelers the story of a picture on the wall. The bulk of the story takes place during WWII at Loch Ness and centers around a little boy that discovers and takes home a large egg.<br /><br />I\\'ll pretty much confirm what other\\'s have said. Yes - it\\'s fit for viewing by all members of the family, but don\\'t let that stereotype trap you into thinking it\\'s only for kids. If you\\'re in the mood for something light, this is a good movie and worth checking out.',\n",
              " b'You are a SEEKER Will! Don\\'t you know what that is?!? This movie is pretty much all that you hate in a movie. The premise of the film is that evil needs five days after Will\\'s 14th birthday to destroy the world. <br /><br />The script is inanely two dimensional. Each character has his or her own theme and that\\'s that. There are no character developments or even a care to it. It just seem that they had a cool outline for a movie and decided to put them in without any consideration to a story.<br /><br />Just so you know, it\\'s not very hard to be a Seeker in this movie. He goes back in time when he sees a sign. He doesn\\'t even need to know what time period, his seeker abilities take care of that for him. Not only do they take him back in time, but he hallucinates the symbol for the \"light\" wherever a sign is located. So his job is to be involuntarily transported back in to to an empty room, see a transparent symbol and put his hand where it was. That\\'s it. \"I never thought you would get this far.\" You\\'ve got to be kidding! This movie plays out like a little kid\\'s video game!<br /><br />The villain is the complete opposite of intimidating, every time he is on screen I chuckled. His weapon of choice? Crows. Yes, that\\'s right, you read that correctly. He uses crows to attack people. Yeah, he\\'s here to destroy all light on the planet and he uses crows to scratch people. Yes, this makes me very scared indeed. <br /><br />The camera tries to make the movie seem like there is action about to happen, but after the third time of these \"action\" sequences that end in a protracted dialog that was, \"Give me the signs boy!\" \"No, I won\\'t!\" \"Fine, Have it your way\" you laugh at the bad guy for his terrible aptitude for being a bad guy and how easy it is to defy this evil power. Then the villain rides off into the distance. It just never made ANY sense. This movie is probably the worst film of the millennium.',\n",
              " b\"City Hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country, state or any sort of major political table. Granted it shines on New York City which is a huge political arena, especially nowadays, but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor's right hand. Director Harold Becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising, Malice, and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault. I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama, not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out...what else...or rather who else...Al Pacino. The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city. As the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss, and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city. As events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up.<br /><br />I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino. I mean even if ONCE he didn't give a good performance how could I ever say it? The man is acting royalty. There is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor. In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor. He has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician. He also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches I've ever seen at the 'James Bone' Funeral. I re-watched that speech four times and the first time I watched Pacino give it, my mouth gaped open and I almost wanted to stand up and applaud. Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino. John Cusack, who I really do enjoy as an actor, turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun. He is kind of the focus of the film and him and Pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance...he seems like he's trying too hard. His accent is just bizarre, and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn't get seem to pull it off. Maybe he was having an off film. Bridget Fonda, on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows Marybeth Cogan. Her performance is very similar to Cusack's in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character. Danny Aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia Frank Anselmo. Martin Landau makes a decent cameo as Judge under scrutiny Walter Stern.<br /><br />The problem with City Hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors. Everyone is...okay. There is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy. And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film. It almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them. So City Hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one BUT it still has to be seen for Pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics. If you just won't see this movie than find Pacino's speech at James Bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes Al Pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it. If you're a John Cusack fan which I am...he's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice. A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss. 7.5/10\",\n",
              " b'I just noticed that \"Melvin and Howard\" registered a mere 6.6 on the IMDb rating scale. Don\\'t you believe it! This is a great American movie. Director Demme and writer Goldman take a footnote to history -- a contested Howard Hughes will that named Melvin Dummar, a milkman who once loaned him a quarter, as one of his heirs -- and turn that slight material into a wry meditation on the American Dream. Or more specifically, the thin line that separates the American Dream from pure hell. Demme has a great eye for people like Dummar, a dreamer whose clock for realizing his dreams is winding down. The performances are terrific, especially Paul Le Mat as Dummar (whatever happened to Le Mat?) and Mary Steenburgen who won an Oscar for playing his wife. Jason Robards does one of his patented cameos playing a real life character (his Howard Hughes makes a neat hat trick with his Oscar winning performances as Dashiell Hammett and Ben Bradley.) Watch for the real-life Melvin Dummar as the counterman in the bus station where Steenburgen makes a sandwich for her daughter. This is a small but knowing and winning movie. It definitely gets my vote for \"Milkman of the Month\"!',\n",

              " b\"There is no bigger fan of ALF the T.V. Series than myself- I realize Paul Fusco was a big fan having created the series however I never would have allowed this stink-filled script to destroy the laugh filled memories of the Alf Franchise. <br /><br />The first couple of minutes between Alf and Beverly Archer(Harriette Byrd in past episodes) was funny but then the film isn't about Alf so much as Military abuse of authority and the love story of two young Doctors who befriend Alf while he is in captivity with the Alien Task Force. The story line is beyond awful and filled with straight line after straight line. The rest of the original cast is gone- and how many laughs did we get from Max Wrights' dead pan deliveries and exaggerated befuddlement? <br /><br />There were so many alternative stories after the final T.V. episode why Fusco chose the worst possible direction is beyond me (maybe he was hanging with Jerry Stahl at the time of conceiving this project) <br /><br />I say to anyone who in later years discovers the Alf television show to stay away from this movie- it is lame unfunny and a pile of steaminess. I compare it to the let down of Highlander 2- it's that very very very bad.\",\n",
              " b'As a teenager, my father and I would go to the local video store and rent a horror movie almost every week. After we got through all the flicks that we had at least heard of, we started on ones we never heard of. One of these flicks was \"Screamtime.\" As stated, this film has three small stories in it. One was about a puppet that may or may not be killing people. This one is okay. The second story was about fairy\\'s that protect this old ladies house and it was pretty dang good. The final one is the best though. It is about a family that moves into a house and the wife keeps seeing murded bodies that are not there. This one has a killer twist at the end that makes this movie worth finding and buying. You can normally get in on Ebay on VHS.',\n",
              " b'\"Girlfight\" follows a project dwelling New York high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem, purpose, and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the film. So much so you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it, \"Girlfight\" is no chick flick and no \"Rocky\". It is, rather, a very human drama which even viewers who don\\'t know boxing will be able to connect with.',\n",

              " b\"Well directed, brilliantly acted and filmed, basically it seemed to be about the earth fighting back, maybe trying to shake off the humans responsible for seemingly devastating it. Very sad in this respect, but a movie that needs to be seen, hopefully to get people thinking about their impact as a collective mass that everyone is having on this poor planet we call home, often to the detriment of all other forms of life which have suffered terribly in one way or another, and I think this is what was being shown in the film, and the spirit of the earth and it's misplaced creatures rising up conveyed this message very well, though not in such detail as to spoil the mysterious effect but in ghostly ways that were just right, not too little and not too much, but just enough to get the message home to what it was really all about. Maybe the director had a different vision to what I am interpreting from what I have seen in it, but this is how it came across to me. Also a very beautiful film to look at in it's pristine whiteness of wilderness.\",\n",
              " b'Don\\'t expect ACROSS 110TH STREET to carry the mile-high groove factor like the A.I.P. movies. This, being a very early entry to the blaxploitation genre, may have triggered controversy over its showing of racial violence to the general public. It was no doubt that 1970 introduced the phase anyway, with COTTON COMES TO HARLEM. Aside from any historical figures, the authentic detail of dark, inner-city Harlem life was the main attraction along with the bloody, nasty violence. Anthony Quinn\\'s appearance doesn\\'t matter, but Yaphet Kotto\\'s indifferences with him add more juice to the film. \"Blaxplo\" fans have seen stuff like this before, but there are plenty of rough guts to chew on in this action drama where the ghetto is no place to hide or escape from. Another fine classic from the gritty 70s.',\n",
              " b\"This is a rip off of the old Frankenstein premise. An acclaimed scientist is killed in a freakish accident and his father, a noted brain surgeon saves the brain. It is then put into a robotic body of his own design. His brother, an electrical genius, gives the 'colossus' impetus to transfer thoughts into motion. The whole project goes bad, when the creation goes berserk.<br /><br />Special effects are undeveloped. The script is lacking. And it is humorous that this is not scary a bit. Well, very small kids will think this is good. If you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on....night, night.<br /><br />The lead characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin.

              " b\"When I first saw the 1952 version of the tale, I felt impressed. In the past, I have been successful avoiding updated versions of classic movies, just to save me from disappointments, but this time I felt like falling in.<br /><br />I was prepared to see much more spectacularity in this 2008 version, the regular special effects, and maybe something new in the script.<br /><br />And yes, there was some new things in the script. A rather inconsistent start, The Cold War is still there, plus the global warning, and maybe the toxic assets. There's also a reference to the altruism enigma.<br /><br />The rest is purely crap.<br /><br />We miss the evangelistic references of the 1952 version. There's no Jude and there's no mortality in Klaatu's enigmatic persona. Instead, he's a rather flat and expressionless superhero, able to control people's mind remotely or bring down helicopters with his hands. No thrill.<br /><br />The rest of the cast ranges from stupid to useless characters. The kid is really hard to stand, and the Secretary Defense is unbelievable. Even the heroin looks little smart despite her academic titles, and there's this pain of watching John Cleese trying to act seriously.<br /><br />But, over all, there you have this gigantic hole in the script. After almost destroying New York (yes, just recovered from the recent havoc of Watchmen!) and lots of stadiums, trucks and the like, Klattu surrenders to rather poor mortal mercy demands, and leaves the planet.<br /><br />Probably then, Klaatu just forgot the movie's name, and sends a command to freeze the whole Earth machinery pool. But... Why does he need to demonstrate his strength with a global warning when he just almost destroyed the planet? Is like sending a newsreel with Los Alamos footage to Hiroshima the 9th of August, 1945. Purely crap. Nonsense crap.<br /><br />Luckily, we still have the 1952 version.\",\n",

The Mel Brooks film has more respect for Mary Shelly than this disaster. No wonder a discount chain sold this to me for $5.50. It wasn\\'t worth it, even at that price! The concept of putting together body parts is a contemporary consideration because we are now able to achieve this. The fact that this was written so long ago (by a woman who was challenged by her husband and a friend to see who could write the best horror story) should give it the historic respect it deserves.
